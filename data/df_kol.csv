38110,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name.

38112,47/ Also a TokenPay entity in Hong Kong was created (again behind a proxy) that was used to dump 2.5 million TPAY coins on the market in exchange for hundreds of valuable domain names that went to personal accounts. The value of the TPAY coin would never recover after this. https://t.co/4spkTiuvvh,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090428626980865,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,145,,5
38113,46/ A TokenPay entity in Switzerland was created (as usual behind a proxy) and stakes were bought into a real estate bank that didn’t make any profits.

38114,45/ Internal pump and dump schemes and very shady business deals and partnerships were suspected to have enabled a large percentage of funds to be siphoned off for personal gain while reducing the BTC value of the TPAY coin for its holders. https://t.co/9SkyygKEsQ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090419491778560,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,164,,4
38115,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090415079337986,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,220,,20
38116,"43/ One of the largest and most prominent crypto scams he has been involved in is the case of TokenPay (TPAY), whereby he pretended again to be an investor, but really was suspected to be acting as the CEO behind the screens.

38117,"42/ Under his own name associated with his company “Equitable Research”, he also wrote for financial media such as The Street and Seeking Alpha, and then realized money could be made with cryptos/ICOs. https://t.co/JMbyWlL9XF",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087844121927684,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,163,,4
38118,"41/ He became active on Twitter trying to provide his analysis on mid cap stocks. His Twitter bio had the slogan “Buy Grief, Sell Hype”.

38119,"40/ Even though Beanie has often mentioned that he never had any social online presence, this was certainly not true.

38120,"39/ This was not unexpected, as it was not uncommon for him to threaten unsatisfied customers that complained to release their personal details (knowing that they would get into trouble). An example of someone that was banned from his forum and Beanie releasing his personal data: https://t.co/lPgPf7pAzU",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086994704154624,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,179,,7
38121,"38/ The case was however dismissed because Beanie allegedly made a deal and sold out all his thousands of paid customers, incl. admins/mods of his forum by handing over all their personal data to the authorities. They all faced criminal charges and were fined. https://t.co/WBPkeK2mvo",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086990585311235,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,252,,21

38123,"36/ Beanie would go on with his dubious practices as the owner (AKA “HU King”) of https://t.co/Qhzdy1JpH2 and co-owner of https://t.co/TfU4tn4OTr, and started to move their hosting servers from his native country Canada to central America, where he currently still resides. https://t.co/l16hgcRbmb",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084461721980933,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,151,,5
38124,"35/ After many complaints and suspected DOS attacks against competitor websites, Beanie apparently came under investigation by Canadian and US enforcement authorities and https://t.co/6sxOk3Wfz0 was discontinued. https://t.co/jhBq3cAuoy",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084457053671427,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,200,,9
38125,"34/ Even then he received so many complaints for scamming on forums, that people were warning for him. We show a screenshot of a forum thread with 14 pages of complaints, and one from another forum with a specific warning about him personally. https://t.co/ijYuOuC8aJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084451374673925,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,198,,7
38126,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084445599027204,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,214,,14
38127,"32/ So was this an isolated incident that Beanie was involved in? When diving into his past, this was only the tip of the iceberg and there is a pattern during his very dubious “professional career”. We briefly provide a chronological overview.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056211390078980,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,213,,4
38128,"31/ There was a Facebook group and website by unsatisfied customers of RGT. When Beanie understood that his identity was linked to RGT and that his name was mentioned on these websites, they paid these people off to take the websites down. This happened in the last two weeks. https://t.co/1cZMSdhVIY",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056207418085380,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,475,,28
38129,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses – they don’t exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056202074529795,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,701,,55
38130,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions “community first”, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056195489443843,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,401,,17
38131,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT’s earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056191949492225,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,356,,23
38132,"26/ The company RGT itself is registered in Panama, with an officer of an offshore entity who is also mentioned in the Panama papers. That will become a recurrent pattern: Beanie generally always hides behind someone else (or a proxy). https://t.co/nGBwCyo7mp",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056184282259459,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,318,,11
38133,"25/ It was probably meant to create the illusion that CryptoBet or ChimpBet have a proper gambling license, because when we checked the status, it seems to be a sub-license of another company, of which there is no trace. The address is associated with another (gambling) company. https://t.co/MLVBeX5h6V",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051439291355141,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,286,,12
38134,"24/ When we checked the status of Corporation Registration Number associated with RGT, it shows that registration was discontinued on 15 April 2020, even though the casinos have been operational after that and still are to this date. https://t.co/T4MNToXQD6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051430856507397,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,285,,6
