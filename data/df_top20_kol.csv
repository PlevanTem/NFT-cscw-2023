22177,"25/ If you are ever caught lying, just say that you have been experimenting a bit with the truth, which to a certain extent can be regarded as the true essence of art. You will hopefully at some point wake up and smell the roses in the infinite Azuki/Ethereum garden. https://t.co/bQ5EgKs09E",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534325482639360,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,168,,11
22178,"24/ Linda Xie is very well connected in the NFT space, is a personal investor in OpenSea, a ""close friend of a16z‚Äù (in a16z‚Äôs own words). Zagabond quit his job at 0x Labs in September and was congratulated on Twitter by Linda Xie and Will Warren. https://t.co/SfDOtnvQ0P",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534317316489217,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,86,,7
22179,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other. Whizwang deleted many tweets (for transparency purposes probably) but did mention that she was part of the zunks team. https://t.co/Hre7maeY1f",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534309628231680,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,84,,3
22180,"22/ It makes it even more shameless to see that in Scalar Capital‚Äôs pitch deck, they explicitly mention that they bought 0x at $0.048. Fun fact: Coinbase just announced 0x Labs as their NFT partner and the price of ZRX skyrocketed. https://t.co/l5KMkEr67F",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534302791516161,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,79,,4
22181,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534295719923712,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,76,,4
22182,"20/ The 2 Scalar Capital founders were heavily involved in developing Coinbase‚Äôs listing procedures along with an engineer (Maksim Stepanenko), who was an advisor to Scalar. The sudden manner in which Coinbase listed 0x (price climbed up 17% within an hour) attracted suspicions. https://t.co/eaposggJkZ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534290225434624,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,67,,3
22183,19/ Scalar Capital claimed that it provides ‚Äúasymmetric info‚Äù and ‚Äúearly access to projects‚Äù to its partners. We know that because a confidential pitch deck of Scalar Capital was leaked. It has some interesting slides. https://t.co/6GGMpwRPO9,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534284122660864,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,78,,2
22184,"18/ Scalar‚Äôs founders invested in 0x‚Äôs public token sale before Coinbase listed it. Scalar‚Äôs co-founder Linda Xie is married to Will Warren, co-founder of 0x Labs‚Äô, the last employer of Zagabond, where he was a founding member and worked for more than 4 years. https://t.co/NZ8b9QgMjI",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534275251720192,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,78,,4
22185,"17/ But it gets worse: The Block posted an article a couple of years ago about the connection between Coinbase, 0x Labs and Scalar Capital. They have removed that article, maybe because Mike Dudas now has his own fund backed by a16z. https://t.co/y3mXpKseMJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534268935147521,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,85,,2
22186,"16/ It is very common for the a16z partners to personally invest in VCs of former colleagues and ex-employees of companies that a16z invested in. Other examples are: Variant Fund, 1Confirmation and Polychain, but there are many more (part of the so called ‚ÄúCoinbase mafia‚Äù). https://t.co/FOdep2bPG3",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534262861836288,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,76,,2
22187,"15/ Indeed, a16z's Marc Andreessen &amp; Chris Dixon personally, but also the 2 co-founders of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, who after that started his own VC Paradigm, and became an advisor to 0x Labs. 0x Labs is a non profit org, but raised $70m from Coinbase &amp; Co. https://t.co/BGz3SOC5u7",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534255223922688,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,75,,4
22188,"14/ Linda Xie, after Coinbase, started a venture capital firm Scalar Ventures with Jordan Clifford, another ex-Coinbase employee. We already mentioned the deep ties between a16z &amp; Coinbase, so you can probably already guess who funded this venture. https://t.co/rp8iMYSGqJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534248672505857,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,73,,2
22189,"13/ Via an interview, we learn that he got introduced to crypto via his friend Linda Xie, herself a very early and well-connected crypto investor who used to work for AIG and then joined Coinbase. She also loves Azuki, but it gets more interesting.

22190,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as ‚Äúlearning experiences‚Äù) and trust the process (don‚Äôt ask any questions, but ‚Äútrust us‚Äù). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534234390904833,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,94,,4
22191,11/ Zagabond was asked about all the ICO scams and said: ‚Äúyou should at least have done as much work as you could have done on the project before trying to raise money‚Äù. Maybe he also forgot about that when raising money with his NFT projects and abandoning them. https://t.co/LfuM2qverZ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534228132913154,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,87,,2
22192,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because ‚Äúthere's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them.""

22193,"9/ When looking at Zagabond‚Äôs digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534214300180481,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,78,,2
22194,"8/ Zagabond has an investment banking background (like quite a few NFT influencers) and moved after a brief stint at Amazon to Google, before spending the last 4 years at 0x Labs. He mentioned that he left his job in September 2021, which is confirmed by his now deleted tweet. https://t.co/rBN5DWZ30L",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534206481907714,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,103,,4
22195,"7/ We think @NFTherder might create a thread about Zagabond‚Äôs blockchain transactions (across the different projects that he was involved in), so we will focus on the IRL relationships. As we said before: https://t.co/l06l1l8clX",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534198709964801,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,86,['NFTherder'],1
22196,"6/ We confirmed Zagabond‚Äôs identity via a couple of different sources: blockchain transactions, comparing his voice with an interview that he did a couple of years ago, and tweets with certain key persons such as Whizwang and certain key timings.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534196298121216,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,101,,2
22197,"5/ If you want to get backed by VCs and/or a corporate brand, you can‚Äôt have any skeletons in the closet and it‚Äôs possible that that was the reason for Azuki to ‚Äúcome clean‚Äù. They added R. Hatoyama as an advisor, who is also venture partner at Sozo Ventures, investor in Coinbase. https://t.co/gkSFonTvsR",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534192858791936,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,99,,7
22198,4/ The main exit strategy currently for founders is that a project gets backed by VCs and/or a corporate (Web2) brand that puts a professional team in place and we have already seen that with some high profile projects.,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534185720094720,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,104,,2
22199,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù, so the current state of the market is that ‚Äúbad news‚Äù for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534183295885312,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,146,,8
22200,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are ‚Äúdedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication‚Äù. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534180376543232,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,215,,19
22201,"1/ We will still provide some additional information on Azuki. Zagabond himself said that he expects to be doxxed at some point and that that is fine, so we will do that.

23430,"25/ Referring to Solano‚Äôs own words below, maybe BAYC is the ultimate crypto hack by some guys that are laughing all the way to the bank having deceived the VCs and their holders in a cryptographic way that aligns with the true nature of cryptography itself. https://t.co/ehDOA1fm2c",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660242954764288,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,41,,3
23431,"24/ Greg Solano wrote the below blog post and you sometimes cannot escape the thought that they have mixed real history with ‚Äúfake history"" that is ""imagined and wonderful‚Äù.

23432,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don‚Äôt know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project.

23433,"22/ Could it be that they wanted to address the notion of the freedom of speech and expression in various parts of society? Maybe.

23434,21/ The word ‚Äúnegro‚Äù is de facto ‚Äúbanned‚Äù and that also applies to the movie Emperor Tomato Ketchup. ‚ÄúNo Sass‚Äù is not a common expression (in particular not for males) and could refer to the fact that Nazi symbols are banned in quite a lot of countries (no SA/SS). https://t.co/EMmEwD8Y8p,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660223157477377,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,26,,1

23437,"18/ In that puzzle, they do make use of some ingenious pattern combinations and some people have therefore made suggestions that the names of the BAYC founders might reveal more about them.

23438,"17/ Gargamel mentioned in an interview that they ""knew all about what this world was"", things are not ""just random"" which can also be concluded from the complicated puzzle that BAYC posted that ultimately could only be deciphered by a team of professionals https://t.co/rtp0fdAY6t https://t.co/oYjLHfDYty",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660191062675458,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,29,,1
23439,"16/ We stumbled upon 4chan threads from 2014 &amp; 2016 that mentioned the term ‚ÄúKali Yuga‚Äù and a French far right politician tweeted about it in 2015.

23440,"15/ We dived a bit deeper in the history of this, especially since the skull on that t-shirt seems to have some resemblances with BAYC‚Äôs logo and because Yuga Labs and ‚ÄúRiding the Kali Yuga‚Äù could also seem to be related.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660176625836032,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,29,,1
23441,14/ There is one Twitter source that predates BAYC by more than a year and another source from an academic William Allchorn who recently wrote a book ‚ÄúMoving beyond Islamist Extremism‚Äù.

23443,"11/ So Greg Solano is basically the only person that could provide us with some hints.

23445,"8/ The two devs of BAYC, Kerem Atalay and Zeshan Ali, both graduated from the University of Maryland (Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences), but apart from that, we have not been able to find much more about them. https://t.co/3UxSyU0Frn",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660126709456898,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,36,,2
23446,7/ We have tried to look into the BAYC founders‚Äô histories (or whatever is available on the Internet and that‚Äôs not much) to see if it‚Äôs possible to understand what their real intentions were and to compare it with what they have told publicly.,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660119524577280,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,33,,2
23447,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660116626321408,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,49,,3
23448,"5/ While both of the above statements might be true, it does not exclude the possibility that the founders have a particular ideology and it doesn‚Äôt go into any of the details. When we know so little about the founders it remains difficult to know their true ideologies/intentions",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660110032912384,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,45,,0
23449,"4/ She basically provides 2 justifications for why this can‚Äôt be true: the BAYC founders all have immigrant backgrounds (Cuban, Jewish, Pakistani &amp; Turkish) and the person who accused them of this, Ryder Ripps, has an underlying agenda to do this.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660106715222016,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,40,,0
23450,"3/ Some people have asked us, either publicly or privately, about our views on BAYC and especially regarding the potential ‚Äúracism allegations‚Äù, to which the CEO of Yuga Labs has responded in the below interview (from 14:57 to 19:00): https://t.co/Zf9W0iBfRd",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660103892443143,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,38,,3
23451,"2/ There are many interesting philosophical issues about what ‚Äútruth‚Äù is, how it relates to the ‚Äúlaw‚Äù and how it is affected by information asymmetries. Part of our perspective is quite well formulated by Christopher Hitchens here: https://t.co/KX1aRcqzl8",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660100692189187,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,41,,1
23452,"1/ This is going to be a bit of a controversial thread, so just some disclaimers.

29271,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1496141681942482944,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,41,,0
29272,"12/ There can be a cultural disconnect. In Europe, everyone who has one failed business is basically not taken seriously anymore, while that is the complete opposite in the US.

29273,"11/ Another one asks a question about why they don‚Äôt take a bit longer than 1.5 month to ask for $13 million USD and if we can see the smart contract in advance.

29274,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question.

29278,"6/ In this podcast, one of the founders mentions that they are great because ‚Äúwe always surround ourselves with incredible people‚Äù (1:10:10), but if you look at the history of some of the ambassadors, you have to wonder how/why they exactly are selected. https://t.co/qDFyIqDH2c",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1496141643875074052,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,46,,1
29279,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot.

29280,4/ On their website they seem to have (purposely) left out the mint price for the NFT on the question how to buy one.

29281,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well.

29282,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don‚Äôt seem to do any research at all.

38096,64/ He also mentioned that the Canada Revenue Agency are ‚Äúretards‚Äù and ‚Äúmuch too dumb‚Äù for crypto. The reason why he still has his Canadian citizenship is because they would otherwise audit him. https://t.co/QiXp0EAGmZ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483113996828000257,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,143,,4

38098,"62/ In the early days of the Larva Labs discord Channel, Beanie has told many things which we have now confirmed to be true. He revealed that he owned a real licensed casino company that was run by Owlman. https://t.co/PBqTZ7iqU4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483111856239751170,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,61,,3

38102,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust.

38103,"57/ When Beanie recently started re-using an old Twitter account for his new fund at GM Capital, he clearly did not seem to have been aware of that fact that this account was suggesting followers to follow the Twitter accounts of all his previous ""scams"". BLASTcx was another one. https://t.co/KGLN5lT50v",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483109547573141507,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,247,,18
38104,"56/ TPAY and TokenPay Suisse AG were transferred to RGT, and many people involved in the ""TPAY scam"" were already well aware of that. The latest Medium post by TokenPay (https://t.co/XNyNNoxwoZ) is that new updates can be followed via RGT and so we have come full circle. https://t.co/qcH7hxCMKM",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483108486011662336,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,140,,5
38105,"55/ According to the website of Huntingdon (using the Wayback Machine which has proven to be still a very valuable tool), he was also an investor in InvestFeed, a website that is currently not accessible anymore as it is investigated by The Financial Commission. https://t.co/b2oa7OSZHQ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483104092822065156,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,145,,3
38106,"54/ The domain name for Huntingdon Investment was only registered just before the ICO launch, so it only seems to be used to provide credibility to the claim that Beanie was only an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù instead of the mastermind behind it. The domain is currently available to register... https://t.co/jpNxPFGcat",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483104087088504835,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,126,,3
38107,"53/ The investment vehicle that he used for TokenPay was Huntingdon Investment Corp, registered on the British Virgin Islands on the same address as TokenPay. The address is also included in the Panama papers. The whitepaper mentions the how critical this ""partner"" was. https://t.co/TF6TU1Mcck",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483103465064783872,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,154,,5
38108,52/ This should not come as a surprise as he recently admitted using 16 Twitter handles and provided proof of that... https://t.co/EHbyJl1GYP,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483103460530786304,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,225,,9
38109,"51/ Beanie was already known to be using many different aliases in order to influence, deceive and manipulate people during his TV piracy business, and that pattern seems to have continued during his time with TokenPay. But certain apps show the name based on your phone number... https://t.co/aWtEDRq5A4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483096856146104322,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,175,,8
38110,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483092769409273860,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,151,,3
38111,48/ The coins they used to buy these domains were those that were refunded after being illegally sold to US investors. https://t.co/gfSN4LXC26,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483092764199956486,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,140,,3
38112,47/ Also a TokenPay entity in Hong Kong was created (again behind a proxy) that was used to dump 2.5 million TPAY coins on the market in exchange for hundreds of valuable domain names that went to personal accounts. The value of the TPAY coin would never recover after this. https://t.co/4spkTiuvvh,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090428626980865,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,145,,5
38113,46/ A TokenPay entity in Switzerland was created (as usual behind a proxy) and stakes were bought into a real estate bank that didn‚Äôt make any profits. They also acquired 7% of a public company stock called Naked Brands (which has not been sold yet). https://t.co/ZLcPfM844W,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090423962914822,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,141,,4
38114,45/ Internal pump and dump schemes and very shady business deals and partnerships were suspected to have enabled a large percentage of funds to be siphoned off for personal gain while reducing the BTC value of the TPAY coin for its holders. https://t.co/9SkyygKEsQ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090419491778560,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,164,,4
38115,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090415079337986,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,220,,20
38116,"43/ One of the largest and most prominent crypto scams he has been involved in is the case of TokenPay (TPAY), whereby he pretended again to be an investor, but really was suspected to be acting as the CEO behind the screens. He wrote the WP foreword, see: https://t.co/Oe2utTitIz",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090411358990336,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,192,,5
38117,"42/ Under his own name associated with his company ‚ÄúEquitable Research‚Äù, he also wrote for financial media such as The Street and Seeking Alpha, and then realized money could be made with cryptos/ICOs. https://t.co/JMbyWlL9XF",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087844121927684,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,163,,4
38118,"41/ He became active on Twitter trying to provide his analysis on mid cap stocks. His Twitter bio had the slogan ‚ÄúBuy Grief, Sell Hype‚Äù. What he is doing with NFTs now, he more or less used to do with stocks. Not everyone always agreed with his analyses... https://t.co/oRgsfQo0l2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087839705407495,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,181,,8
38119,"40/ Even though Beanie has often mentioned that he never had any social online presence, this was certainly not true. He used to have a Twitter account with over 12k followers, a Facebook account and a LinkedIn profile. https://t.co/CMpAyolbdj",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086999099740164,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,174,,8
38120,"39/ This was not unexpected, as it was not uncommon for him to threaten unsatisfied customers that complained to release their personal details (knowing that they would get into trouble). An example of someone that was banned from his forum and Beanie releasing his personal data: https://t.co/lPgPf7pAzU",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086994704154624,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,179,,7
38121,"38/ The case was however dismissed because Beanie allegedly made a deal and sold out all his thousands of paid customers, incl. admins/mods of his forum by handing over all their personal data to the authorities. They all faced criminal charges and were fined. https://t.co/WBPkeK2mvo",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086990585311235,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,252,,21
38122,"37/ Both websites were however sued by DirecTV (also known as Dave, after the VP and Head of Signal Security David Baylor) and the legal court case documents can still be found online, see (1) https://t.co/geZhWGt2El, (2) https://t.co/RujiUsR5OI and (3) https://t.co/CoL45AHewD",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084464070832128,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,152,,5
38123,"36/ Beanie would go on with his dubious practices as the owner (AKA ‚ÄúHU King‚Äù) of https://t.co/Qhzdy1JpH2 and co-owner of https://t.co/TfU4tn4OTr, and started to move their hosting servers from his native country Canada to central America, where he currently still resides. https://t.co/l16hgcRbmb",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084461721980933,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,151,,5
38124,"35/ After many complaints and suspected DOS attacks against competitor websites, Beanie apparently came under investigation by Canadian and US enforcement authorities and https://t.co/6sxOk3Wfz0 was discontinued. https://t.co/jhBq3cAuoy",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084457053671427,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,200,,9
38125,"34/ Even then he received so many complaints for scamming on forums, that people were warning for him. We show a screenshot of a forum thread with 14 pages of complaints, and one from another forum with a specific warning about him personally. https://t.co/ijYuOuC8aJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084451374673925,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,198,,7
38126,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084445599027204,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,214,,14
38127,"32/ So was this an isolated incident that Beanie was involved in? When diving into his past, this was only the tip of the iceberg and there is a pattern during his very dubious ‚Äúprofessional career‚Äù. We briefly provide a chronological overview.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056211390078980,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,213,,4
38128,"31/ There was a Facebook group and website by unsatisfied customers of RGT. When Beanie understood that his identity was linked to RGT and that his name was mentioned on these websites, they paid these people off to take the websites down. This happened in the last two weeks. https://t.co/1cZMSdhVIY",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056207418085380,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,475,,28
38129,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses ‚Äì they don‚Äôt exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056202074529795,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,701,,55
38130,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions ‚Äúcommunity first‚Äù, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056195489443843,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,401,,17
38131,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT‚Äôs earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056191949492225,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,356,,23
38132,"26/ The company RGT itself is registered in Panama, with an officer of an offshore entity who is also mentioned in the Panama papers. That will become a recurrent pattern: Beanie generally always hides behind someone else (or a proxy). https://t.co/nGBwCyo7mp",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056184282259459,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,318,,11
38133,"25/ It was probably meant to create the illusion that CryptoBet or ChimpBet have a proper gambling license, because when we checked the status, it seems to be a sub-license of another company, of which there is no trace. The address is associated with another (gambling) company. https://t.co/MLVBeX5h6V",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051439291355141,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,286,,12
38134,"24/ When we checked the status of Corporation Registration Number associated with RGT, it shows that registration was discontinued on 15 April 2020, even though the casinos have been operational after that and still are to this date. https://t.co/T4MNToXQD6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051430856507397,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,285,,6
38135,"23/ On different forums, TrustPilot, and Reddit, there are many complaints about CryptoBet. In particular it is frequently mentioned that once you win a jackpot in their casinos, they flag your account as ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù (without explanation) and you are not able to withdraw anything https://t.co/Md5V5whiXs",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051423743066119,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,311,,11
38136,"22/ TokenPay was transferred to RGT, and it was easy to find out that the same person behind CBET and TokenPay was also the person behind RGT. In fact, before he used the name Beanie, he used the name EC on Discord, which corresponds to one of his many TokenPay twitter handles. https://t.co/1eTndL01k3",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051414532280320,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,328,,13
38137,"21/ When typing in the real name of Owlman into OS, an ENS domain showed up attached to an account (0x08ac0605d7dca266735e9686dd90285b9e4952f0) with an interesting history. It was the deployer of CBET, a ‚Äúscam token‚Äù, associated with a variety of ‚Äúscam projects‚Äù, incl. TokenPay. https://t.co/HD29IBYdHe",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051407703949314,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,375,,17
38138,"20/ According to his LinkedIn profile, Owlman is IRL the General Manager of RGT, and even though Beanie has mentioned multiple times that he is a dev, he is not. https://t.co/QLz2xBwUQd",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051401647472643,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,267,,7
38139,"19/ There is a CryptoBet video on YouTube that features a person that has exactly the same voice as the MBD project lead Owlman (Twitter handle: Owlman1of1), and during one of the MB Twitter Spaces Beanie mentioned his first name, which did indeed match. https://t.co/fAgBJELle4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051390935379971,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,259,,7
38140,"18/ When ChimpBet was launched, the publicly announced director of ChimpBet was directly identified as a Sales Director of RGT and people also noticed a resemblance with another RGT project called https://t.co/013tPQirQR. https://t.co/J57ZvsxYua",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051380101234691,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,288,,10
38141,"17/ The so called ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051372090175497,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,346,,9
38142,"16/ Many OG holders asking critical questions about the project were banned from the Discord. And when Beanie was asked whether he knew RGT, he denied ever having heard of it (see screenshots). But, in actual fact, it turns out he is the owner of RGT. https://t.co/rjhvuK8fyC",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051363563098113,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,324,,12
38143,15/ People in the Monkey Bet DAO Discord already had noticed that the name RGT (Royal Gaming Technology) was mentioned in the T&amp;Cs of various MBD websites and the Company Registration number and slot designs were identical to the ones from RGT. https://t.co/oZ0Udl7tll,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051355229114373,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,282,,12
38144,"14/ Before answering that question, we first explain how we were able to discover his identity. We have to go back to a project called Monkey Bet DAO by ‚ÄúInvariant Labs‚Äù (IL) that Beanie says he invested a ""very small"" amount in. That could not be further from the truth. https://t.co/OWDhS4kPk1",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051346148433921,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,310,,16
38145,13/ Beanie describes himself in one of his online profiles attached to his real name as ‚Äúabsent of a strong work ethic‚Äù and as someone ‚Äúwho takes pride in the fact that he has never had a real job in his life‚Äù. So how was he able to become so ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù? https://t.co/9KYFWDzjT9,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051340309966854,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,403,,28
38146,"12/ For those that only believe things when they hear it (most won't have ever seen him, but will recognize his voice), we provide hereby a short part of a video in which you can hear his voice. He is not visible, because we cut it in such a way that no one is recognizable. https://t.co/bLZNVrYTre",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051333808795648,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,307,,10

38149,"8/ We also don‚Äôt want any project that the person in question has been investing in to be negatively affected, and we urge these projects to distance themselves from this individual and to clarify their relationship with him.
