3,2,actually,"12/ To be fair to Beanie, he actually contributed in many ways to the NFT space. His tweets were intelligent and engaging about interesting projects, and nothing compared to what we currently see with scam rings using the ‚ÄúFollow, Retweet &amp; WL/Giveaway‚Äù, incentivized by greed."
4,2,actually,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.

2,2,access,@zachxbt @NFTethics @fRiENDSiES_Ai Would you have a problem with this if it was disclosed by each influencer? I also believe there was an additional NFT you could have purchased that gave you access to this which I thought was reasonable. Doodles is one of many projects where influencers were given mint passes too
