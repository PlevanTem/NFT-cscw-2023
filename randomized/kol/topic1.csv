0,1,actual,"14/ I then begin to look for clues on who the team actually is. 

I check the chain &amp; find clear ties to two different million dollar NFT rug pulls (first noticed by @NFTethics ) Ancient Cats Club &amp; Crazy Camels.

See below how the transactions tie back to two CEX accounts. https://t.co/KQveVsTwxr"
1,1,actual,5/ Such events make you question who actually “rules the world” and how it’s possible that those that abused the system (e.g. banks) are actually rewarded for that by being bailed out. We have talked about perverse incentives before.
2,1,actual,"16/ Many OG holders asking critical questions about the project were banned from the Discord. And when Beanie was asked whether he knew RGT, he denied ever having heard of it (see screenshots). But, in actual fact, it turns out he is the owner of RGT. https://t.co/rjhvuK8fyC"
3,1,actual,"5/ However, when the actual work needs to be done, most of the founders have already made enough money to retire and have less of an incentive (or none at all) to actually put in the work that they promised from the start."
4,1,actual,".@bapesclan so much for stepping up and respecting the NFT community, and actually hearing out questions. The success or failure of your project directly correlates with the actions you have taken over the last 5 days and it shows that people should not trust you to deliver"
0,1,accessible,"55/ According to the website of Huntingdon (using the Wayback Machine which has proven to be still a very valuable tool), he was also an investor in InvestFeed, a website that is currently not accessible anymore as it is investigated by The Financial Commission. https://t.co/b2oa7OSZHQ"
1,1,accessible,@AlyssaOliha @afrofrenchchick “Inclusive and accessible” at 0.3ETH… to who?! 😱
2,1,accessible,"@annemckinnell I'm so honoured to know about you and your father.. It's so inspiring. ❤️🙏

we are trying to make this NFT space more inclusive and accessible for deaf community ❤️"

4,1,accessible,"Good Evening fam! 

@Tibalism collected my edition today.  He is joining with me to advocate inclusivity in NFT space and make them more accessible for artists with Disabilities. 

21 editions are collected. ❤️ Quite a long way to go! 

who is joining with me for the mission? https://t.co/pgpXKVGQzs"
0,1,action,"21/ We always said that actions always speak louder than words, whether they are digital or physical, and we are of course willing to have this verified."
1,1,action,"1/ Someone shared a screenshot of @MetaMansionsNFT’s response to our thread about them. We would like to ask them to show/share all the proof that they have about our interaction with them. Of course there is none, but it’s always interesting to see what they come up with. https://t.co/oAATMXRdq4"
2,1,action,15/ Or you can pay a one-off “fine” to increase your TRUSTH score and compensate for all the errors of judgement that you made in the past. The money will be distributed to those with a high(er) TRUSTH score that were affected by your wallet transactions.
3,1,action,"Unethical transactions on the blockchain are comparable to a stored blood sample from an athlete that used doping. They might think they have gotten away with it but the detection methods are getting better every day, and one day, the sample will be retested &amp; you will be exposed"
4,1,action,"@j1mmyeth @nft42_ Yes, you did and provided proof that this transaction was a bundle deal that didn't show up at OpenSea as such, but was completely legitimate. Thanks!"
0,1,absolutely,"@NFTethics Never said anyone should remain silent.

No one is perfect, we should absolutely be weighing both the good and the bad.

Evaluation is important."
1,1,absolutely,"Not gonna lie, my experience w @BlockpassOrg has been absolutely horrible. No transparency, horrible UI, &amp; support is a joke — they legit require u to buy “priority pass” to reach customer service. 

Do what u will with this information @yugalabs, @BoredApeYC, @animocabrands."
2,1,absolutely,"Gm frens, trust absolutely no one today. CT/NFT twitter is excellent at trolling and people are gonna have a field day for April fools. 😂❤️"
3,1,absolutely,"some think i talk about @artblocks_io a lot because i own many mints &amp; because i'm a small angel investor in it

but i own those works &amp; equity because i believe it will absolutely become one of the most culturally relevant entities in #NFT history

in fact, i think it already is"
4,1,absolutely,"@gmhannah You’re absolutely right, the Mellies are of the best, most inclusive and support communities in web3! ❤️"
0,1,active,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN"
1,1,active,"@artskooltourist @Friendswithyou The tweet served the purpose to show that they were ""reasonably early"" active in the NFT space and connected with many currently quite prominent NFT ""influencers""."
2,1,active,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
3,1,active,1/ We haven’t been so active recently as things are starting to get quite predictable in the NFT space. We foresaw the BAYC acquisition of Larva Labs’ main IP (and we look forward to Andreessen Horowitz’s further instructions and involvement :-)) https://t.co/XiAelDoBac

0,1,ability,I don’t have any spicy takes on today’s news but I will defend the notion of anonymity in Web3. There are so many working anon here for many reasons including personal safety &amp; the ability to navigate the space without the bias that may follow their intersecting identities.

0,1,act,4/4 An example is a team member of a project minting tomorrow using a Twitter account from an attorney (who confirmed he was locked out of his account). 99.99% of the 6400 tweets have no relationship with NFTs. Another example is of an actress whose account now has been restored. https://t.co/f4vpRnYEVZ

2⃣ building this space further together as a community
3⃣ beeing an active force on a bigger goal for NFT art
4⃣ finding ppl who love my art,artistic energy &amp; share my values/vision

what makes you feel satisfied or successful?"
2,1,act,"@grikeshrike @zodd_immortal 99% certain this is a scam. It has all the common scam characteristics and the 2 ""social media founders"" on the team are known for their unethical behavior."
3,1,act,"@jjabram19 I think knee-jerk reaction bad with equities, after that rally"
4,1,act,"2/ They would either reach out to celebrities or celebrities would contact them, so if you have been rugged, know that @jf_nft/@0xAA_NFT were responsible. They allegedly told insiders not to buy what they posted at @NFT IG because they knew they were rugs.

0,1,account,"For those who don't know about the dubious history of the account NFTmachine. He blocked us immediately for a reason, even though we never reported about him. He probably knew we would however at some point do that.

1,1,account,"19/ If an account has a lot of engagement from “fake” followers or “bots” via inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means its score will be low. In the future further weighing can be given to accounts that have shown to be more “truthful” than others."

4,1,account,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"
0,1,actually,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
1,1,actually,"@NFTethics tbf my mistake for fading that part of the thread, actually a v important point"
2,1,actually,@tw1tte7 @beaniemaxi @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame @punkscomic I don't trust anyone except @greatmando_nft actually.
3,1,actually,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
4,1,actually,"2/ No word from Marc Andreessen when Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated, but David Horowitz, the father of Ben Horowitz, actually did respond. He seems to suggest that it was completely deserved and the right thing to do: https://t.co/eYnNCtn2Uw https://t.co/YpQhFtXn8n"
