3,5,accessible,"This was one of our biggest weeks in web3:

✅Minting DAPP completed
✅7 Twitter spaces done &amp; dusted
✅2 interviews in the works

Everyday we meet more folks that share our vision. A world that is accessible, inclusive &amp; equitable for all✊🏽🌈 https://t.co/sdztb6gVt0"

Our Mentorship Program matches mentees to diverse leaders in web3.

And, we’re creating a FREE onboarding course that breaks down web3 &amp; NFTs and makes crypto less cryptic. 

Bc accessible education 🤝 empowered individuals = a diverse #web3."
0,5,absolutely,"@gmhannah You’re absolutely right, the Mellies are of the best, most inclusive and support communities in web3! ❤️"
1,5,absolutely,@UnknownCo123 absolutely! I'm already on mission to educate photography to my deaf community. planning to introduce NFT platform to them and It will make more inclusive ❤️
2,5,absolutely,"Not gonna lie, my experience w @BlockpassOrg has been absolutely horrible. No transparency, horrible UI, &amp; support is a joke — they legit require u to buy “priority pass” to reach customer service. 

Do what u will with this information @yugalabs, @BoredApeYC, @animocabrands."
3,5,absolutely,"Gm frens, trust absolutely no one today. CT/NFT twitter is excellent at trolling and people are gonna have a field day for April fools. 😂❤️"
4,5,absolutely,"Ironically the 2 biggest rules for NFTs are:

 - Make friends with everyone
 - Trust absolutely no one"
0,5,actually,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

1,5,actually,"14/ I then begin to look for clues on who the team actually is. 

I check the chain &amp; find clear ties to two different million dollar NFT rug pulls (first noticed by @NFTethics ) Ancient Cats Club &amp; Crazy Camels.

See below how the transactions tie back to two CEX accounts. https://t.co/KQveVsTwxr"
2,5,actually,"@NFTethics tbf my mistake for fading that part of the thread, actually a v important point"
3,5,actually,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of “democracy” to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
4,5,actually,"@NFTherder @youbekindtoday FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out."

1,5,action,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,5,action,"1/2 - Dear @andy8052, as the founder and CEO of @fractional_art, we noticed that Beanie/GM Capital claims to be an investor in Fractional. Please see the screenshots below on two of his main websites. https://t.co/CuaOtqdvOU"

0,5,able,"19/ Next on the list is a profile named “ZLOVE11”. Via some blockchain transactions, an IG profile and a website, we were able to find this person’s identity, which could be a friend of one of the BAYC founders as he resides in Miami. https://t.co/pu20h0ZPCo"
1,5,able,@youfoundtessya Women can do what they want. They are able to everything unfortunately our parents educated us to be quiet and pretty. A good girl. And we have to educate the next generation with equality between girls and boys and give more confidence to our girl about theirs capacity
2,5,able,@NFT_Awareness @cryptoShields @NFTethics @zachxbt @NFTherder . @TwitterSafety this truly is unacceptable
3,5,able,"69/ Instead of competing with each other, we hope the NFT space is able to come up with new and innovative self-regulating mechanisms to create an ethical blockchain and ecosystem that doesn’t reward perverse incentives."

2,5,ability,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1

2,5,act,"2/ After we posted that we would expose some scam rings in Dubai (where you live), you decided to close the Discord for any new members. Did you know that one of the characteristics of Web3 is that everyone should be able to participate and there should be no “gatekeepers”? https://t.co/yIcBVUJt2O"
3,5,act,@nftjorge @zachxbt @NFTethics Exactly this.
4,5,act,"3/ Some claim that this is especially disturbing since a @GalacticApesNFT genesis holder recently offered 200 ETH to buy the project, while it now seems to have been “handed” over for free. No (proper) explanation has been provided as to why they thought this is a better option."
0,5,access,@lorigraceaz @thehugxyz We’ll be there! Inclusivity &amp; accessibility are our middle names 👏🏽
1,5,access,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."

0,5,account,"Just for the avoidance of doubt. The verified account @BhawanaCAN is an obvious scam promoting an ""Ape Coin airdrop"" and also the verified account of @ToddWasserman has been hacked and used for scamming.

2,5,account,"1/3 These large Twitter accounts are all part of the same (invisible) cartel involved in scamming people by promoting rugs. They blocked us all at the same time, which is no coincidence. And they all use Bored Apes and CryptoPunks as PFP, and fake competitions to gain followers. https://t.co/GmBB8XGtfH"
3,5,account,"@nftjorge You haven't provided any (proper) examples to prove your point. As said before, we can justify every single post and we also never deleted tweets like so many others in this space do, so we remain fully accountable. Please note that true ""objectivity"" simply does not exist."
4,5,account,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F

The NFT will be a basic model, which over time? will be customizable, upgradeable and interactive. 

The moral of this lengthy story? $POODL is NOT a #memecoin but a TRUE #UtilityToken and will go from strength to strength

Our price? is TINY. Our offering is HUGE.

2,5,active,"@Degentraland @AzukiOfficial Rug pulling is illegal and there are multiple people in the USA actively being charged and tried in court for it. Especially when its millions of usd. It's not moral to rugpull then use that to make a ""real project"". Wtf."
3,5,active,"@voi_cu_tudor The artists are not the problem. They get paid 5 figures to make the art look attractive enough so that people will pay high mint prices. But you don't know the founders and they just mentioned that they sold out. They had a supply of 8888, but there are only 5200 items listed. https://t.co/xXJq79Bkt3"
4,5,active,"3/ They are often influencers with large followings: Farokh, Deeze, Ohhshiny (who blocked us - more about that next week when we discuss all the billionaires active in the NFT space), and they did lots of interviews with all of them. https://t.co/XcXCA7Wwcb"
