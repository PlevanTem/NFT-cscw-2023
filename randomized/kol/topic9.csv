0,9,ability,"3/ Decentralization has various advantages, but also specific disadvantages for which the NFT space currently does not have a solution. Anonymous people have less of an incentive (or even no incentive at all) to act morally/ethically and to take accountability for their actions."

0,9,actual,"12/ Another account highlighted the below news story, which in actual fact appears much bigger and damning than anyone so far has published. The Twitter/IG handles of NFT were immediately deleted after this news story to bury the evidence
https://t.co/GsIWemPI87"
1,9,actual,5/ Such events make you question who actually “rules the world” and how it’s possible that those that abused the system (e.g. banks) are actually rewarded for that by being bailed out. We have talked about perverse incentives before.
2,9,actual,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
3,9,actual,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
4,9,actual,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."

2,9,access,@TGTOWYT The owner of the Twitter account confirmed that his account was compromised and he currently doesn't have access to it. He contacted Twitter about it. Jpegenthusiast does indeed like to transfer his assets to different wallets (this one 31 times): https://t.co/enNhIckY7s

0,9,actually,"@TakeoffTone @MGrizzlyBP21 @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame I'll tell ya now I'm not one to blindly trust influencers. We've spent a lot of time carefully selecting our investments and this is one we like and comfortable to be patient on. I actually prefer it that it's taking time, rather that than something rushed. Ppl are too impatient."
1,9,actually,"2/ No word from Marc Andreessen when Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated, but David Horowitz, the father of Ben Horowitz, actually did respond. He seems to suggest that it was completely deserved and the right thing to do: https://t.co/eYnNCtn2Uw https://t.co/YpQhFtXn8n"
2,9,actually,@tw1tte7 @beaniemaxi @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame @punkscomic I don't trust anyone except @greatmando_nft actually.
3,9,actually,"1/ For those people asking why we always come up with ""FUD"" on projects on mint day. We generally have never heard of any of these projects, but we receive currently about 200 DMs per day. We had received between 5-10 about CerealClub and actually more than 5 about Bunny Buddies."
4,9,actually,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"
0,9,action,"6/ We confirmed Zagabond’s identity via a couple of different sources: blockchain transactions, comparing his voice with an interview that he did a couple of years ago, and tweets with certain key persons such as Whizwang and certain key timings."
1,9,action,"12/ Years ago this was already very well known, but of course no action was ever taken. Everyone benefited was the short-term view, but it ultimately also eroded people’s appetite to pay taxes and their sense of justice. And dirty money and venture capital became more entangled. https://t.co/3HnaloWyJw"
2,9,action,"Many VCs/investors claim to love everything Web3: the transparency, the fact that everyone can participate and no one can be censored/blocked and that transactions on the blockchain are immutable. But they often behave the complete opposite way and they determine Web3's future. https://t.co/I8CiA1WOsY"
3,9,action,"@darrenrovell @DanielitoG25 @TyHaliburton22 It's an exercise of trust between two parties, how i conduct my trading is my decision. The NFT exists on the chain and was transferred on the chain. Payment just arrived later via a transaction on the chain. All it did was reduce the total volume analytics for @BoredApeYC"
4,9,action,"20/ When we deal with (anon) people that we only know via digital interactions, we often fill in the things we don’t know in the most favorable way we imagine. We project our own fantasies to fill in the blanks, which is part of the reason why good people are so often scammed."
0,9,act,"2/ We also did extensive analysis on Beanie's transactions but did not include any of that data in our initial thread. Even though a lot of data is irrefutable, the context/interpretation of why certain transactions have taken place always remains up for multiple interpretations."
1,9,act,"aped in on Les Non Fongible Femmes, an all-female NFT project that minted this week and got little exposure

I'm loving the inclusivity of this 500 token project

just got done talking with the founder, she hand drew these traits then coded and deployed her own smart contract 💁‍♀️ https://t.co/LpMjADKCPn"
2,9,act,"@3thirty3tv If you would have read all the 70 tweets, you would have noticed that we did not mention any specific projects that Beanie was involved in other than MBD (as that project was the link to his identity). We actually put in a couple of disclaimers including: https://t.co/ap0CipmZLC"

4,9,able,"68/ We also urge all relevant authorities and jurisdictions to investigate this individual and his accomplices in their involvement in a large number of very dubious and potentially fraudulent projects and, if applicable, to hold them accountable to the full extent of the law."
0,9,account,"19/ If an account has a lot of engagement from “fake” followers or “bots” via inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means its score will be low. In the future further weighing can be given to accounts that have shown to be more “truthful” than others."
1,9,account,@AmanduhhEth @degenables @cat_loafer @TheHumanoidsNFT @NFTethics So your account was newly created in Feb 2022 and your 2nd follow is @degenables. Hi degenables's alt account 🤣🤣🤣🤣
2,9,account,"People are saying founders of NFT projects need to doxx in order for us to trust them. We need to also start holding anons that are rent-a-cops that fud ppl &amp;  projects &amp; demand that they doxx themselves too. When what they say is proven wrong, they need to be held accountable."
3,9,account,That @NFTethics account coming with that thunder 👻 got y’all scammers ( I mean influencers ::coughs:: )  running around like the Clintons 💀
4,9,account,"3/ One profile clearly shows involvement in this project and his real Twitter account is screenshotted below. The reason we know this is that when he handed over the project to the community, people discovered this. https://t.co/JvDzlrchti"
0,9,active,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN"
1,9,active,"1/ Maybe it's interesting to mention some background on Crypto888crypto, someone already quite long active in the crypto world by shilling low Market Cap (MC) alt coins. He has deleted many tweets and also confirmed that, but we still have them all saved.

2,9,active,"6/ In some way it’s not fair to call out these individuals, because there are literally hundreds of similar people active in this space, all with connections to morally bankrupt agencies, sporters, celebrities, social media executives, etc. We have called them out in the past."
3,9,active,"3/ This (former) ""Trailer Park Kid"" seems to love it all. His background is quite similar to many ""Web3 influencers"". The best ""Tinder/Twitter swindlers"" across the globe have united and they are all active in crypto/NFTs. They have all it takes to make it in this space. WAGMI! https://t.co/LM39p887uS"
4,9,active,"5/ The project has blocked and booted every person that knows what’s going on from their Discord, including @tylengyel, the most active member who owns the trademark to Bored Bunny. The project didn't respond to his C&amp;D letter. https://t.co/eDmAaevesi"
