1,6,action,We push active users of the NFT Community and if you want my attention you should bid on one of them. Their celebration will alert all of us and it‚Äôs your fastest way to traction here. Trust me üíé
2,6,action,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
3,6,action,"5/ We call it TRUSTH and it stands for Transparency, Trust and Truth. Trust refers to your digital actions on the blockchain, Truth refers to your digital words on social media, and Transparency pervades both. They are all (inter)connected."

 - Trust absolutely no one"

0,6,active,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
1,6,active,"3/ Fun fact: Katie Haun received an NFT as a birthday gift from Elena Silenok, who is also quite active in the NFT space and the wife of a16z's Chris Dixon. Katie Haun is also still a board member of both OpenSea and Coinbase (as is Dixon, there are deep ties between a16z &amp; CB) https://t.co/GBfzLD8okf"
2,6,active,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN"
3,6,active,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say ‚ÄúWAGMI‚Äù and ‚ÄúCare for the community‚Äù, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."

0,6,act,Dear Amir (@mondoir) - a quick reminder to let you know that your company accounts are overdue. Just letting you know in case you don't have an accountant or they were not able to contact you. Always happy to help. https://t.co/g5lCAxKnNi
1,6,act,"6/ Or are there certain characteristics that should serve as a red flags, in the same way that spam filters detect spam. There are so many projects coming out each day and alerting people is time-sensitive. After mint, it is not relevant anymore. That always is a trade-off."
2,6,act,"@inflammable_eth @mysavagedogs Twitter doesn‚Äôt give enough character to explain how bias, discrimination and marginalisation works but they‚Äôre here and thriving sadly."
3,6,act,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
4,6,act,"2) As far as we know, we're the first NFT project to provide actual training &amp; development to create the next generation of diverse leaders.

It was important for us to combine the power of web3 and NFT's with real-world impact. 

Now, let's take a look at the Curriculum:"
0,6,actually,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
1,6,actually,"@cryptoShields @NFTethics @jwilliamsnft We actually disagree here, and is why we have fully doxxed our founders. You do have a very significant impact on the statements made about projects. Obviously the work we all do comes with risks, but being doxxed eliminates any concerns about any other intentions"
2,6,actually,"16/ Since people have become more hesitant about projects with non-doxxed founders, these scam rings now often pay ‚Äúpuppets‚Äù that pretend that they are the ‚Äúfounders‚Äù, so that naive people think that the founders are actually doxed."
3,6,actually,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

https://t.co/3yi82PAf5L"
4,6,actually,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

1,6,ability,"@TorBair @GuyZys @Irenezhao_ @SecretNetwork i think for a lot of NFT art, people view the full auditability and transparency of the asset as a positive

i do think this will change as we have different kinds of NFTs over time (going beyond art), but why does it need another network?"
2,6,ability,"3/ Decentralization has various advantages, but also specific disadvantages for which the NFT space currently does not have a solution. Anonymous people have less of an incentive (or even no incentive at all) to act morally/ethically and to take accountability for their actions."

1,6,able,@zachxbt @NFTethics @fRiENDSiES_Ai Would you have a problem with this if it was disclosed by each influencer? I also believe there was an additional NFT you could have purchased that gave you access to this which I thought was reasonable. Doodles is one of many projects where influencers were given mint passes too
2,6,able,"@0xQuit Many people are often not able to predict in advance which projects are ""going to help us build"", certainly not when the founders are undoxxed. Less or no money upfront means less incentive to scam, and almost no liquidity drain. Now it's 0% risk for founders, 100% for holders."
3,6,able,"@iamDCinvestor Ya, but LL could‚Äôve sold to Hasbro one day too.

Instead, they chose Yuga. And if you love and trust LL so much, don‚Äôt you trust their judgement and decision to entrust Punks to Yuga? 

Change is inevitable. And in LL‚Äôs eyes this was change in the right direction."
4,6,able,"We never endorse projects, but both @GoGalaGames and @BT are very reputable and their involvement in the NFT/Web3 space is beneficial to all.

We hope that any new players will choose the influencers that they want to work with very wisely in the future.

0,6,actual,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
1,6,actual,"1/ A quick update on MontanaBlack who in actual fact seems to have &gt;20 million followers on all kinds of platforms. The story shows how many of these scam rings operate.
