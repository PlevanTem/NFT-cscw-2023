1,3,absolutely,"Not gonna lie, my experience w @BlockpassOrg has been absolutely horrible. No transparency, horrible UI, &amp; support is a joke — they legit require u to buy “priority pass” to reach customer service.

0,3,able,@tyummk87 @meow_nft @cryptoShields @NFTethics @jwilliamsnft Agreed wholeheartedly. We were specifically talking about Scam Watcher channels like @NFTethics @cryptoShields and @rugpullfinder - we should be just as accountable for what we talk about just as the promises projects make are - so intentions are very clear
1,3,able,"11/ The person in question is Beanie (Twitter handle: beaniemaxi) and we have confirmed his identity via different independent sources. Any evidence provided is from publicly available data and can be verified, in the true spirit of Web3."
2,3,able,"Transparent, on chain verifiable, tamper proof - this is how we build a safer community."
3,3,able,Dear Amir (@mondoir) - a quick reminder to let you know that your company accounts are overdue. Just letting you know in case you don't have an accountant or they were not able to contact you. Always happy to help. https://t.co/g5lCAxKnNi
4,3,able,"24/ We mentioned earlier that self-regulation is key to move this space further (mainstream). To add an incentive: those that will be able to come up with ethical solutions, will likely be the ones that will financially benefit from this space the most. https://t.co/t61tJy9a63"
0,3,active,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
1,3,active,9/ We have provided some background info on 888. He has also not been active on Twitter anymore. Maybe he travelled to Thailand to buy himself a(nother) wife or maybe he is busy asking Harvey Weinstein for legal advice. https://t.co/4mDbTTpB4v

3,3,active,"3/ The Discord automatically censors anyone that mentions your real name and you also proactively ban people with critical questions. Both censoring and blocking people is not part of the true spirit of Web3, so why are you trying to become active in this space? https://t.co/fsTPtee47H"
4,3,active,"41/ He became active on Twitter trying to provide his analysis on mid cap stocks. His Twitter bio had the slogan “Buy Grief, Sell Hype”. What he is doing with NFTs now, he more or less used to do with stocks. Not everyone always agreed with his analyses... https://t.co/oRgsfQo0l2"
0,3,act,"3/ Take @Farokh, who admitted in the past that he will do everything for engagement. There was a 2016 article about Farokh in Forbes (now deleted from the website for obvious reasons), which explains exactly how important the network is. Please read it. https://t.co/O7wIB4IoSc"
1,3,act,@DiamondHands_D @Nftethicsclown @NFTethics @futurenftmints Holy shit! This is exactly why we won't jeopardize our credibility by taking payments for any investigation or audit
2,3,act,"@MetaMikeG @OzarkNFT Following our discussions with @NFTethics and @rugpullfinder tomorrow, his break may be extended. You can have your own opinions, not your own set of facts."
3,3,act,"@cryptoShields @NFTethics @jwilliamsnft We actually disagree here, and is why we have fully doxxed our founders. You do have a very significant impact on the statements made about projects. Obviously the work we all do comes with risks, but being doxxed eliminates any concerns about any other intentions"
4,3,act,"2/ With each trust-minimized service that Chainlink provides to #Web3, new smart contract verticals can take off. Examples:

• Price Feeds + OCR = secure and scalable #DeFi
• VRF = provably fair and transparent #NFT mints
• Keepers = reliable and automated smart contracts https://t.co/CWMdm1UKuf"
0,3,actually,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."

2,3,actually,"@TakeoffTone @MGrizzlyBP21 @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame I'll tell ya now I'm not one to blindly trust influencers. We've spent a lot of time carefully selecting our investments and this is one we like and comfortable to be patient on. I actually prefer it that it's taking time, rather that than something rushed. Ppl are too impatient."
3,3,actually,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"

2,3,account,".@NFTethics the same account that exposed beanie as a fraud was about to expose a bunch of projects as being run by scammers and rug pullers and their account was suspended. Seems a little curious, no? Here’s the last tweet they sent heads up if u own 1 of these projects https://t.co/Xvmkt5DbRY"
3,3,account,"@nftjorge You haven't provided any (proper) examples to prove your point. As said before, we can justify every single post and we also never deleted tweets like so many others in this space do, so we remain fully accountable. Please note that true ""objectivity"" simply does not exist."
4,3,account,4/4 An example is a team member of a project minting tomorrow using a Twitter account from an attorney (who confirmed he was locked out of his account). 99.99% of the 6400 tweets have no relationship with NFTs. Another example is of an actress whose account now has been restored. https://t.co/f4vpRnYEVZ
0,3,action,2/2 - We did however not see Beanie/GM Capital listed as a formal investor on any of the publicly disclosed funding rounds. Would you be willing to clarify if/how he invested in Fractional and if you are in the process of disassociating from him after his exposure? https://t.co/xvAMJ4LVFZ
