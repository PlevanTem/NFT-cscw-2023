1,10,absolutely,"@3dlyfer This is mind blowingly insane. Really appreciate you not taking on the blind-trust aspect, I feel that it could potentially lead to someone out there harming people üñ§ absolutely love this work and will collect asap"
2,10,absolutely,"some think i talk about @artblocks_io a lot because i own many mints &amp; because i'm a small angel investor in it

but i own those works &amp; equity because i believe it will absolutely become one of the most culturally relevant entities in #NFT history

in fact, i think it already is"
3,10,absolutely,"@NFTethics Never said anyone should remain silent.

No one is perfect, we should absolutely be weighing both the good and the bad.

Evaluation is important."
4,10,absolutely,"Ironically the 2 biggest rules for NFTs are:

 - Make friends with everyone
 - Trust absolutely no one"
0,10,action,"7/ We think @NFTherder might create a thread about Zagabond‚Äôs blockchain transactions (across the different projects that he was involved in), so we will focus on the IRL relationships. As we said before: https://t.co/l06l1l8clX"
1,10,action,"1/ Someone shared a screenshot of @MetaMansionsNFT‚Äôs response to our thread about them. We would like to ask them to show/share all the proof that they have about our interaction with them. Of course there is none, but it‚Äôs always interesting to see what they come up with. https://t.co/oAATMXRdq4"

4,10,action,2/2 - We did however not see Beanie/GM Capital listed as a formal investor on any of the publicly disclosed funding rounds. Would you be willing to clarify if/how he invested in Fractional and if you are in the process of disassociating from him after his exposure? https://t.co/xvAMJ4LVFZ
0,10,act,"Millions worth of NFTs stolen today after the new OpenSea contract migration. This should be an eye opener to how important it is that we have a wide selection of NFT platforms and always be cautious of what we sign, even with a platform we trust and use regularly"
1,10,act,"10/ We did indeed find that also Gregory Solano also graduated from the University of Maryland, and didn‚Äôt find anything about Wylie Aranow, apart from the fact that his father was very (in)famous and some of the info he revealed in interviews (""his gambling-problem days""). https://t.co/LyF9VFtQCQ"

3,10,act,"23/ If you don‚Äôt disclose this information, but it is found out by others/algorithms, it can have an impact on your TRUSTH scores. It‚Äôs unfortunate that mechanisms and measures like this are necessary, but as we said earlier: https://t.co/SfSzt0fesq"
4,10,act,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.
0,10,active,"@SerpentAU The whole gaming/esports scene is completely corrupt(ed) and many of those people are currently active in the NFT space. All pretending to be honest (you exposed Kquid for cheating), but you turned out to be the biggest cheater yourself and denied it first. Very hypocritical. https://t.co/yvanUeMPPX"
1,10,active,"@artskooltourist @Friendswithyou The tweet served the purpose to show that they were ""reasonably early"" active in the NFT space and connected with many currently quite prominent NFT ""influencers""."
2,10,active,". @rollbitcom 

You announced the winner of this BAYC almost a month ago - Why is it still sitting in your wallet? Not looking very transparent.

You should also explain how you used the original mint profit to participate in active Opensea trading of other NFT projects"
3,10,active,"@POODLETOKEN Anyone involved in anon projects that they don't want to see rug should be recommending Assure actively to the devs and in the community!

We are trying to help deter rugs with our KYC #NFT that we provide for project owners! 

More trust to investors!

4,10,active,1/ We haven‚Äôt been so active recently as things are starting to get quite predictable in the NFT space. We foresaw the BAYC acquisition of Larva Labs‚Äô main IP (and we look forward to Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs further instructions and involvement :-)) https://t.co/XiAelDoBac

3,10,able,"@BamAlegre_ We specifically mentioned that people that are new to the NFT space shouldn't mint any project, because they won't be able to make a proper distinction between legit and scam projects. Sometimes it's better to be safe than sorry."
4,10,able,"I've never been more excited about a generative social avatar NFT project

the quality of the artwork, the diversity and inclusion, the charitable donations, the transparency of the team behind it, @worldofwomennft is an obvious winner

the bar just got raised on profile pic NFTs https://t.co/BU6LAnkkbq"
0,10,actually,"@NFT_Guru I don't understand why an influencer needs to remain anonymous. It's definitely okay and its their choice, but it helps build trust when you can actually know they are a real human"
1,10,actually,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
2,10,actually,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
3,10,actually,"I actually found an NFT project that I trust in the sea of scames: @Salamanders_NFT.

I like these guys. They fulfill most of the criteria I am looking for in projects and I'm comfortable recommending them."
4,10,actually,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

https://t.co/3yi82PAf5L"
0,10,actual,"5/ However, when the actual work needs to be done, most of the founders have already made enough money to retire and have less of an incentive (or none at all) to actually put in the work that they promised from the start."

I like these guys. They fulfill most of the criteria I am looking for in projects and I'm comfortable recommending them."
2,10,actual,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
3,10,actual,@pixelbot24 Fair point. :) These are actual real names of NFT collections. And we do have all the names of the people behind these rugs.
4,10,actual,@web3love @NFTethics @NFTherder They didn‚Äôt prove anything. I‚Äôve already proved them wrong. Nothing they posted shows any actual shady activity with my charity. They also used clips from a fake website that someone bought my name domain and wrote what they wanted to write about me and my kids. Literally 0 facts

this is every day in NFT‚Äôs.

we are the NFT space."
2,10,access,@zachxbt @NFTethics @fRiENDSiES_Ai Would you have a problem with this if it was disclosed by each influencer? I also believe there was an additional NFT you could have purchased that gave you access to this which I thought was reasonable. Doodles is one of many projects where influencers were given mint passes too
3,10,access,"NFT-based #blockchain game @PandoraInvasion is integrating #Chainlink VRF to access verifiably random, tamper-proof numbers to fairly distribute and upgrade in-game #NFT Champions, helping create a more transparent and exciting gaming experience for users. https://t.co/Yy1Bnp4Uve"
4,10,access,"@isaidelgoley Thank you for what you are doing.. How about inclusivity in NFT space? many artists with Disabilities aren't having access since they depend on sign language. 

What will future look like for inclusive platforms? we need our voice to be heard too."
0,10,account,"57/ When Beanie recently started re-using an old Twitter account for his new fund at GM Capital, he clearly did not seem to have been aware of that fact that this account was suggesting followers to follow the Twitter accounts of all his previous ""scams"". BLASTcx was another one. https://t.co/KGLN5lT50v"
1,10,account,@metakry @Cryptopathic @GmGoodMorning @LooksRareNFT @NFTethics That was the biggest pump and dump among big Twitter accounts in the history of CT. But everybody awfully silent. Big accounts protect big accounts and so many big accounts were pumping this.
2,10,account,"So tomorrow HypeBears(Club) are going to mint for 0.4 (!) each, which would net the team a profit of 4000 ETH (&gt;$11 million). The team consisting of 3 anon &amp; very suspicious Twitter accounts, including one with a compromised account from an attorney. What could possibly go wrong? https://t.co/84NnYGgvsM"
3,10,account,"@TGTOWYT All Twitter accounts are old, but 2 of them (TheRickk &amp; Jpegenthusiast) don't have any tweets prior to Nov 2021. The account from xy_square is compromised. Check any of the 6000 older tweets. MAYC is mentioned in the founder's profile, but he doesn't own any. There is no roadmap."
