0,4,actual,"2/3 He actually pointed out the same issue with LarvaLabs earlier than we did yesterday, and even seems to indicate that that was the reason that LarvaLabs didn’t dump all their 1000 V1 Punks because they got caught out by him. https://t.co/FllJ19V1Y3"
1,4,actual,"@NFTethics tbf my mistake for fading that part of the thread, actually a v important point"
2,4,actual,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

3,4,actual,"@TakeoffTone @MGrizzlyBP21 @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame I'll tell ya now I'm not one to blindly trust influencers. We've spent a lot of time carefully selecting our investments and this is one we like and comfortable to be patient on. I actually prefer it that it's taking time, rather that than something rushed. Ppl are too impatient."
4,4,actual,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
0,4,active,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
1,4,active,"3/ They are often influencers with large followings: Farokh, Deeze, Ohhshiny (who blocked us - more about that next week when we discuss all the billionaires active in the NFT space), and they did lots of interviews with all of them. https://t.co/XcXCA7Wwcb"
2,4,active,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say “WAGMI” and “Care for the community”, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."
3,4,active,"@SerpentAU The whole gaming/esports scene is completely corrupt(ed) and many of those people are currently active in the NFT space. All pretending to be honest (you exposed Kquid for cheating), but you turned out to be the biggest cheater yourself and denied it first. Very hypocritical. https://t.co/yvanUeMPPX"
4,4,active,We push active users of the NFT Community and if you want my attention you should bid on one of them. Their celebration will alert all of us and it’s your fastest way to traction here. Trust me 💎
0,4,actually,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"

2,4,actually,@elgatonegro01 @NFTethics just this actually exist. most ppl are sending their eth to the same teams over and over again based on unreal promises.
3,4,actually,"@NFT_Guru I don't understand why an influencer needs to remain anonymous. It's definitely okay and its their choice, but it helps build trust when you can actually know they are a real human"
4,4,actually,"@duckdarryl @KarafuruNft @Jejouw @NFTethics @soloandrw_ they literally announced it in their discord. Also, they're actually paying to mint where as @RTFKTstudios got more than 200 clone's for free and a handful of ultra rares.."
0,4,ability,"@TorBair @GuyZys @Irenezhao_ @SecretNetwork i think for a lot of NFT art, people view the full auditability and transparency of the asset as a positive

i do think this will change as we have different kinds of NFTs over time (going beyond art), but why does it need another network?"
1,4,ability,I don’t have any spicy takes on today’s news but I will defend the notion of anonymity in Web3. There are so many working anon here for many reasons including personal safety &amp; the ability to navigate the space without the bias that may follow their intersecting identities.

2,4,act,@web3love @NFTethics @NFTherder They didn’t prove anything. I’ve already proved them wrong. Nothing they posted shows any actual shady activity with my charity.

1,4,able,"@punk9059 I somewhat agree. While I wish yuga comm’s were more frequent/transparent, their MO is to announce what they did not what they are going to do. It’s a dev-first approach vs a marketing-first approach. It’s uncomfortable, but IMHO it’s why they are so successful. Build &gt; Hype. https://t.co/e3xHmLGgwx"

2,4,access,@zachxbt @NFTethics @fRiENDSiES_Ai Would you have a problem with this if it was disclosed by each influencer? I also believe there was an additional NFT you could have purchased that gave you access to this which I thought was reasonable. Doodles is one of many projects where influencers were given mint passes too

0,4,account,"5/ The DM Slide

If you engage in NFT communities, at some point you will receive a DM from a seemingly authentic account. Know that it is VERY unlikely for any project to DM you out of the blue.

4,4,action,"An update on the situation with LarvaLabs. They admitted they ""made a mistake"" and did a ""stupid thing"". Now they are going to take action against the IP they created which preceded theirs. Decentralization meets centralization.
