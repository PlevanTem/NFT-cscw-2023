2,14,access,@NFTDefense @GB_301 Multiple people also mentioned that the Haus Discord is only accessible for holders and that Assa blocked/banned people. Not very Web3 to say the least. https://t.co/HmX62yKzKB

1,14,able,7/ We have tried to look into the BAYC founders’ histories (or whatever is available on the Internet and that’s not much) to see if it’s possible to understand what their real intentions were and to compare it with what they have told publicly.
2,14,able,"Thanks to its energy-efficient and sustainable technological architecture, #Tezos has become the #blockchain of choice for a diverse community of #CleanNFT artists and innovative #NFT platforms."
3,14,able,"7/ He furthermore claims that the whole team is working 20 hours a day, that they created something only Google also has (and therefore can't elaborate on that), and that their whole team consists of geniuses. He does not seem to understand how unbelievably unbelievable he sounds"
4,14,able,"GM #NFT Fam! Our Wave 4 PixelSaurs are already gaining adopters, and you can still get in on Waves 1-3. The range of diverse Dinosaurs are fun, collectable and investable, and are already gaining some great traction!

0,14,actual,"@white_house_eth @LooksRareNFT Insider trading can have many different forms. Our statement is quite factual: if you don't know who the owners of a company are, they can never be accused of insider trading. It's interesting with the news today about LooksRare and the amount of money that went to TornadoCash."
1,14,actual,"@TakeoffTone @MGrizzlyBP21 @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame I'll tell ya now I'm not one to blindly trust influencers. We've spent a lot of time carefully selecting our investments and this is one we like and comfortable to be patient on. I actually prefer it that it's taking time, rather that than something rushed. Ppl are too impatient."
2,14,actual,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"
3,14,actual,"@austinonchain @NFTethics I could, actually."
4,14,actual,"12/ Another account highlighted the below news story, which in actual fact appears much bigger and damning than anyone so far has published. The Twitter/IG handles of NFT were immediately deleted after this news story to bury the evidence
https://t.co/GsIWemPI87"
0,14,absolutely,@isabellaarnao @NonFungibleRing absolutely.  just give us time to rebalance our rights and possibilities and I hope on the contrary that men will help us to build this path of equality. 💪🏼♥️
1,14,absolutely,"@NFTethics Never said anyone should remain silent.

No one is perfect, we should absolutely be weighing both the good and the bad.

Evaluation is important."
2,14,absolutely,"@3dlyfer This is mind blowingly insane. Really appreciate you not taking on the blind-trust aspect, I feel that it could potentially lead to someone out there harming people 🖤 absolutely love this work and will collect asap"
3,14,absolutely,"@gmhannah You’re absolutely right, the Mellies are of the best, most inclusive and support communities in web3! ❤️"
4,14,absolutely,"Gm frens, trust absolutely no one today. CT/NFT twitter is excellent at trolling and people are gonna have a field day for April fools. 😂❤️"
0,14,active,"If anything I have built credibility by being as active as I am in the space. It helps build trust and connections with other nft communities and I'd rather be be more involved than not. 99% of NFT creators are not as involved as me, I see it as an edge.

I will share others. ⬇️ https://t.co/JlyjY8wTM2"
1,14,active,". @rollbitcom 

You announced the winner of this BAYC almost a month ago - Why is it still sitting in your wallet? Not looking very transparent.

You should also explain how you used the original mint profit to participate in active Opensea trading of other NFT projects"
2,14,active,"@Degentraland @AzukiOfficial Rug pulling is illegal and there are multiple people in the USA actively being charged and tried in court for it. Especially when its millions of usd. It's not moral to rugpull then use that to make a ""real project"". Wtf."
3,14,active,"@chief_NFT @bears_deluxe A game, vx and $honey all on the way. Plus an extremely solid community and active transparent dev team"
4,14,active,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say “WAGMI” and “Care for the community”, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."
0,14,act,@007_shank I know you went out of your way to make that bid in time &amp; also — a great deal of trust was extended. The piece is exactly where it belongs 🖤🍸🧊
1,14,act,"#NFT fractionalization protocol @uniclyNFT is integrating #Chainlink Keepers to automate routine maintenance tasks like token reward distributions &amp; swapping of NFT fees to native tokens, helping ensure processes are automated in a trust-minimized manner.
https://t.co/ugHCfuFAeC"
2,14,act,"1/ Dear Haya - as you are one of the founders of @diverse, and someone with almost 4M followers on IG before it was inactivated, we have a couple of quick questions. We noticed that your old twitter handle @023 is suspended, but we did like the photo with your $900k watch. https://t.co/HIkXV3btAg"
3,14,act,"57/ When Beanie recently started re-using an old Twitter account for his new fund at GM Capital, he clearly did not seem to have been aware of that fact that this account was suggesting followers to follow the Twitter accounts of all his previous ""scams"". BLASTcx was another one. https://t.co/KGLN5lT50v"
4,14,act,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
0,14,account,@ThreeSwordsCap @greatmando_nft @NFTethics I don't think you are supposed to view it as one account that is the arbiter of nft ethics. It's an account that will collate community feedback (I'm sure they get a lot of DMs on potential scammers) and they will in turn provide evidence if there is something there.
1,14,account,Now we are at it: the ruggers/scammers of Billionaire Dogs Club were Guillaume Rassemi and Laurent Correia (who has over 3M followers on his IG account). Also living in Dubai and of course driving in fancy cars as you do. https://t.co/b5WnIthM0x
2,14,account,".@NFTethics the same account that exposed beanie as a fraud was about to expose a bunch of projects as being run by scammers and rug pullers and their account was suspended. Seems a little curious, no? Here’s the last tweet they sent heads up if u own 1 of these projects https://t.co/Xvmkt5DbRY"
3,14,account,We would greatly appreciate if you could go through all our thousands of spam emails each day and provide proof if they are legit or not. There might be one where someone really wants to send $10M to my bank account and split the difference as a thank you https://t.co/MtP07inymb
4,14,account,"3/ One profile clearly shows involvement in this project and his real Twitter account is screenshotted below. The reason we know this is that when he handed over the project to the community, people discovered this. https://t.co/JvDzlrchti"
0,14,actually,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of “democracy” to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
1,14,actually,"1/ For those people asking why we always come up with ""FUD"" on projects on mint day. We generally have never heard of any of these projects, but we receive currently about 200 DMs per day. We had received between 5-10 about CerealClub and actually more than 5 about Bunny Buddies."
2,14,actually,"1/ Multiple sources confirmed to us that Mark Cuban's @NFT IG team actually created NFTs for the celebrities that they worked with. They would share the profit 50/50 and the celebrities didn't have to do anything. @NFT hired the artists, ran the Discords and did everything else. https://t.co/qfxoeK8t4f"
3,14,actually,"The story about @Farokh &amp; @tailopez is actually worse. Tai was a client of Farokh's company Good Life and he was mentioned on multiple websites as a reference client (just like GaryVee). Tai's name has now been removed, but the screenshots are still there.

4,14,actually,26. NFT NYC is amazing. It's unreal to see some of our favourite artworks and collectibles on the big screens at Time Sq. Tbh it's iconic. I don't think crypto has ever united this many people before in such an inclusive and friendly way. It's actually epic and amazing to see.
0,14,ability,@BenjaminBitcoin @CreativeEggz @ElladaArt @myleontieva @anastasiyanft @properpablo @nadsam_art @MTroino @vikakuzy @Nlo47_nft @tarentulart awesome. Looks amazing. Do you have any plan for making NFT platform more inclusive? I believe it helps to identify more talents from disability community.

0,14,action,".@bapesclan so much for stepping up and respecting the NFT community, and actually hearing out questions. The success or failure of your project directly correlates with the actions you have taken over the last 5 days and it shows that people should not trust you to deliver"
1,14,action,"@Artifaction2 Hi!

Thank you so much for the opportunity. 

The land of Light ❤️

I'm here for the mission to empower deaf community and make #nft space more inclusive.

2,14,action,2/2 - We did however not see Beanie/GM Capital listed as a formal investor on any of the publicly disclosed funding rounds. Would you be willing to clarify if/how he invested in Fractional and if you are in the process of disassociating from him after his exposure? https://t.co/xvAMJ4LVFZ
3,14,action,"12/ Years ago this was already very well known, but of course no action was ever taken. Everyone benefited was the short-term view, but it ultimately also eroded people’s appetite to pay taxes and their sense of justice. And dirty money and venture capital became more entangled. https://t.co/3HnaloWyJw"
