Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out."

Written by @hollydmoore 
August 30 2021

When it was discovered that a $150 Million ‘women-led #NFT was actually run by some Russian guys.

""Importance of #community &amp; #transparency!""

3,11,actually,"10/ We see messages about ""diversity"", but they probably do not realize that if you take out such a big amount of ETH out of the NFT ecosystem with a $100m mint, you are actually making this space less diverse. https://t.co/m9J3mxeJEn"
4,11,actually,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
0,11,able,"54/ The domain name for Huntingdon Investment was only registered just before the ICO launch, so it only seems to be used to provide credibility to the claim that Beanie was only an “investor” instead of the mastermind behind it. The domain is currently available to register... https://t.co/jpNxPFGcat"
1,11,able,"@Utd_SocietyNFT @randomfrankp @cryptocomnft NFTs are about transparency vs technical “prevention.” This is similar to an artist selling a limited edition print - they can technically lie and make more, but then their reputation is tarnished forever. 

This is not an acceptable practice. Buy from more respectable artists."

0,11,absolutely,"some think i talk about @artblocks_io a lot because i own many mints &amp; because i'm a small angel investor in it

but i own those works &amp; equity because i believe it will absolutely become one of the most culturally relevant entities in #NFT history

in fact, i think it already is"
1,11,absolutely,"Gm frens, trust absolutely no one today. CT/NFT twitter is excellent at trolling and people are gonna have a field day for April fools. 😂❤️"
2,11,absolutely,"Not gonna lie, my experience w @BlockpassOrg has been absolutely horrible. No transparency, horrible UI, &amp; support is a joke — they legit require u to buy “priority pass” to reach customer service. 

Do what u will with this information @yugalabs, @BoredApeYC, @animocabrands."
3,11,absolutely,"@NFTethics Never said anyone should remain silent.

No one is perfect, we should absolutely be weighing both the good and the bad.

Evaluation is important."
4,11,absolutely,"@gmhannah You’re absolutely right, the Mellies are of the best, most inclusive and support communities in web3! ❤️"
0,11,act,"3/ Also nepotism is completely standard in the NFT space, so the fact that GaryVee (Gennady), his brother AJ, Beeple and some old friends received the Proof collective for free is standard. We saw quite a lot of other ""old"" friends that received the proof collective for free/$3. https://t.co/o20NOgfIM4"
1,11,act,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.
2,11,act,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
3,11,act,"3/ This (former) ""Trailer Park Kid"" seems to love it all. His background is quite similar to many ""Web3 influencers"". The best ""Tinder/Twitter swindlers"" across the globe have united and they are all active in crypto/NFTs. They have all it takes to make it in this space. WAGMI! https://t.co/LM39p887uS"

0,11,action,2/2 - We did however not see Beanie/GM Capital listed as a formal investor on any of the publicly disclosed funding rounds.

2,11,active,There is a reason why none of the true NFT experts and influencers on Twitter (active for more than a year) have never ever heard of or mentioned many projects. They are only advertised via paid spam/scam accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Check your project and who promoted it.
3,11,active,"6/ The Bored Ape that Gwyneth Paltrow announced to have received via MoonPay on 26 Jan 2022 was already purchased by MoonPay more two months earlier (15 Nov 2021).
