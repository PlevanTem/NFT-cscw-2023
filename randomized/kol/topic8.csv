1,8,actual,"@cryptoShields @NFTethics @jwilliamsnft We actually disagree here, and is why we have fully doxxed our founders. You do have a very significant impact on the statements made about projects. Obviously the work we all do comes with risks, but being doxxed eliminates any concerns about any other intentions"
2,8,actual,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
3,8,actual,"The story about @Farokh &amp; @tailopez is actually worse. Tai was a client of Farokh's company Good Life and he was mentioned on multiple websites as a reference client (just like GaryVee). Tai's name has now been removed, but the screenshots are still there.

I check the chain &amp; find clear ties to two different million dollar NFT rug pulls (first noticed by @NFTethics ) Ancient Cats Club &amp; Crazy Camels.

See below how the transactions tie back to two CEX accounts. https://t.co/KQveVsTwxr"
1,8,actually,"@NFT_Guru I don't understand why an influencer needs to remain anonymous. It's definitely okay and its their choice, but it helps build trust when you can actually know they are a real human"
2,8,actually,@tw1tte7 @beaniemaxi @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @wolfdotgame @punkscomic I don't trust anyone except @greatmando_nft actually.
3,8,actually,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

2,8,act,"@diverse @023 We have asked some legitimate questions and leave it up to others to judge whether they find your answers satisfactory. We have more info about the other founder (who also lost his IG verification) and his GF, and about your dev Praj that was associated with the banned @NFT IG. https://t.co/flasygWtMY"
3,8,act,@QueenyMartha 💖 Totally. Although I do think non binary folks should always be welcomed into women centred space too if they wish to be. In fact I should have been more inclusive with my initial language.
4,8,act,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.

1,8,action,"6/ We confirmed Zagabond’s identity via a couple of different sources: blockchain transactions, comparing his voice with an interview that he did a couple of years ago, and tweets with certain key persons such as Whizwang and certain key timings."
2,8,action,"@RogerDickerman @ohhshiny Was quite confused on this one, as I’ve had nothing but positive interactions with @ohhshiny, thanks for shining your opinion and views on it Roger, as I trust yours implicitly.

3,8,action,"Unethical transactions on the blockchain are comparable to a stored blood sample from an athlete that used doping. They might think they have gotten away with it but the detection methods are getting better every day, and one day, the sample will be retested &amp; you will be exposed"
4,8,action,"12/ Years ago this was already very well known, but of course no action was ever taken. Everyone benefited was the short-term view, but it ultimately also eroded people’s appetite to pay taxes and their sense of justice. And dirty money and venture capital became more entangled. https://t.co/3HnaloWyJw"

The NFT will be a basic model, which over time? will be customizable, upgradeable and interactive.

3,8,active,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
4,8,active,"@Degentraland @AzukiOfficial Rug pulling is illegal and there are multiple people in the USA actively being charged and tried in court for it. Especially when its millions of usd. It's not moral to rugpull then use that to make a ""real project"". Wtf."

2,8,account,@ThreeSwordsCap @greatmando_nft @NFTethics I don't think you are supposed to view it as one account that is the arbiter of nft ethics. It's an account that will collate community feedback (I'm sure they get a lot of DMs on potential scammers) and they will in turn provide evidence if there is something there.
3,8,account,"2/2 When confronted with that, he said that his account was hacked by someone else and that he didn't have anything to do with it. In December the kind soul @Zeneca_33 already wrote a thread about him. Shame that a small minority makes us all less trustful https://t.co/EYdquGmTg4"

2,8,able,@DayDreamers_nft Lol the offer was ridiculous at 5x the market for a hoodie punk w/ 3D glasses. People would’ve been like okay cool you upgraded your punk. It’ll be impossible to know if this a smart move long term. Brand equity re: specifically punk’s incalculable
