I follow these 3 accounts so far that tweet abnormal NFT activity. No one else.

Feed = No noise, no bias opinions, just facts. https://t.co/ZSR6gtfnum"

2,13,act,"1/ A quick update on MontanaBlack who in actual fact seems to have &gt;20 million followers on all kinds of platforms. The story shows how many of these scam rings operate. There is always someone in the background doing the ""dirty"" work functioning as the intermediary and fall guy. https://t.co/SVtpeby664"
3,13,act,"@NFTethics This thread looks good so far. I will be very interested to see who it is that exactly is getting all this money. I did not trust coinbase when it first started, and neither should anyone. Coinbase will capture so many regular people and trap them in a centralized hole."
4,13,act,@NFTethics ok. This might be a factual account of what happened. But let's consider that the USA's laws on securities/tokens/crypto is totally bullshit and we don't really have laws or good guidance. Back then they didn't even really say it was taxable.
0,13,actual,"FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out https://t.co/R5eRU4VBXV"
1,13,actual,"Chainlink VRF brings new levels of transparency to #dApps requiring RNG.

With #Chainlink VRF, @ChimpySwap can now prove that winners of Mega Chimpy drawings are actually chosen at random and that each #NFT minted in its upcoming drop is verifiably rare. https://t.co/5bpfTt5RV8"
2,13,actual,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
3,13,actual,@web3love @NFTethics @NFTherder They didn’t prove anything. I’ve already proved them wrong. Nothing they posted shows any actual shady activity with my charity. They also used clips from a fake website that someone bought my name domain and wrote what they wanted to write about me and my kids. Literally 0 facts
4,13,actual,"@Fitz01_eth Insider trading can have many different forms. Our statement is quite factual: if you don't know who the owners of a company are, they can never be accused of insider trading. It's interesting with the news today about LooksRare and the amount of money that went to TornadoCash."
0,13,actually,"1/ Multiple sources confirmed to us that Mark Cuban's @NFT IG team actually created NFTs for the celebrities that they worked with. They would share the profit 50/50 and the celebrities didn't have to do anything. @NFT hired the artists, ran the Discords and did everything else. https://t.co/qfxoeK8t4f"
1,13,actually,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

2,13,actually,@elgatonegro01 @NFTethics just this actually exist. most ppl are sending their eth to the same teams over and over again based on unreal promises.
3,13,actually,"2/ No word from Marc Andreessen when Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated, but David Horowitz, the father of Ben Horowitz, actually did respond. He seems to suggest that it was completely deserved and the right thing to do: https://t.co/eYnNCtn2Uw https://t.co/YpQhFtXn8n"
4,13,actually,"@NFT_Guru I don't understand why an influencer needs to remain anonymous. It's definitely okay and its their choice, but it helps build trust when you can actually know they are a real human"
0,13,action,".@bapesclan so much for stepping up and respecting the NFT community, and actually hearing out questions. The success or failure of your project directly correlates with the actions you have taken over the last 5 days and it shows that people should not trust you to deliver"
1,13,action,"@j1mmyeth @nft42_ Yes, you did and provided proof that this transaction was a bundle deal that didn't show up at OpenSea as such, but was completely legitimate. Thanks!"
2,13,action,@DanniSychoMom @safemoon Go to @refinableapp and connect your trust wallet to the website once it’s connected you should be able to buy the nft for pennies to pay for the transaction fees
3,13,action,"18/ This can be based on different metrics: the repetitiveness/originality of messages, the amount of deleted messages, the number of times people are blocked by this account, the number of times the handle has changed, ratio of followers to friends, interaction, etc."
4,13,action,"In real life, everyone's identity and their “relationships” are generally public information, but not their private financial transactions. In the crypto/NFT space the opposite applies: blockchain transactions are public, but the IRL identity and “relationships” are often hidden."
0,13,ability,"I have been asked why am I talking about disability often in #NFT space. It's very appalling! 

If I am not advocating about disability and inclusivity, who will do that? Identity doesn't matter anymore? #nftphotography #NFTartists #inclusivity"

0,13,active,"4/ Some tweets by others that confirm that people were banned from their Discord (always an extremely red flag) and WL spots were not given to active community members, but to famous/successful people (and friends of the insiders). https://t.co/vYN0L1veGm"
1,13,active,". @rollbitcom 

You announced the winner of this BAYC almost a month ago - Why is it still sitting in your wallet? Not looking very transparent.

You should also explain how you used the original mint profit to participate in active Opensea trading of other NFT projects"
2,13,active,"3/ They are often influencers with large followings: Farokh, Deeze, Ohhshiny (who blocked us - more about that next week when we discuss all the billionaires active in the NFT space), and they did lots of interviews with all of them. https://t.co/XcXCA7Wwcb"
3,13,active,"🏔️🐐's motivations:
1⃣ decentralisation,transparency
2⃣ building this space further together as a community
3⃣ beeing an active force on a bigger goal for NFT art
4⃣ finding ppl who love my art,artistic energy &amp; share my values/vision

what makes you feel satisfied or successful?"
4,13,active,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
0,13,absolutely,@UnknownCo123 absolutely! I'm already on mission to educate photography to my deaf community. planning to introduce NFT platform to them and It will make more inclusive ❤️
1,13,absolutely,"I am all for 'influencers' receiving NFT/ETH in return for promoting a project, so long as it is done in a way of transparency and integrity.

I personally would disclose if I was paid to promote something and I would absolutely not do anything to take advantage of the community."
2,13,absolutely,"Gm frens, trust absolutely no one today. CT/NFT twitter is excellent at trolling and people are gonna have a field day for April fools. 😂❤️"
3,13,absolutely,"@gmhannah You’re absolutely right, the Mellies are of the best, most inclusive and support communities in web3! ❤️"
4,13,absolutely,"@3dlyfer This is mind blowingly insane. Really appreciate you not taking on the blind-trust aspect, I feel that it could potentially lead to someone out there harming people 🖤 absolutely love this work and will collect asap"
0,13,able,1/ Our idea to make this space more ethical is by making morality more valuable than money in the future. It will pay off to behave ethically and it will cost you if you behave immorally. We provide a decentralized self-regulatory blueprint as a starting point for discussion.
1,13,able,"@nftjorge You haven't provided any (proper) examples to prove your point. As said before, we can justify every single post and we also never deleted tweets like so many others in this space do, so we remain fully accountable. Please note that true ""objectivity"" simply does not exist."
2,13,able,"This was one of our biggest weeks in web3:

✅Minting DAPP completed
✅7 Twitter spaces done &amp; dusted
✅2 interviews in the works 
✅1 team member offer sent

4,13,able,"History will judge very hard on big social media influencers on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., pretending to be reputable and reliable, for selling a young generation of naive and easily influenced people worthless NFTs for tens of millions of dollars."
0,13,account,"@Loopifyyy @dudistpriest_ @zachxbt based on zacks “definition of a rug” every project I was a part of isn’t a rug

all the big nft twitter accounts hold Azuki so the amount of bias is incredible 

everything so hypocritical 

it’s laughable"
1,13,account,"@effutrollme @NFTethics Loves @NFTethics ?  I don’t think that’s right.  I think just like any other collection we have some people who like the account, some who don’t, and most don’t care that much"
2,13,account,"9/ Interestingly after our account was suspended, this person did immediately respond in quite a predictable way. Ultimately you can’t hide your true nature. https://t.co/BoR8diW73L"
3,13,account,"For all the thousands of people that like, retweet and follow all the NFT projects that TheJenus promotes, we here share you the rates that that they charge. Zero effort, zero accountability - only interested in $.

We talked about perverse incentives in the NFT space before... https://t.co/o9NvLZ40BO"
4,13,account,"Yes, @MutantXApe (minting today) is a scam. Undoxxed team, empty roadmap, Twitter account with 24k followers in 1 month, closed Discord with 100k members, and their AMA on YouTube was also made private. Apparently they used actors to feature in that AMA.
