1,0,actual,I am more likely to trust people actually in the NFT space than outsider journalists writing about it.
2,0,actual,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

4,0,account,@JStargeth @jesse_altman @NFTethics Yea but they got banned because they were allegedly impersonating another account 🧐 seems very likely someone didn’t want them exposing them and used a tonne of accounts to report them for something they clearly were not doing
0,0,actually,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"
1,0,actually,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."

4,0,actually,"@NFTherder @youbekindtoday FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space.
