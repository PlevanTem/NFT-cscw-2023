No one is perfect, we should absolutely be weighing both the good and the bad.

Evaluation is important."
1,12,absolutely,"I am all for 'influencers' receiving NFT/ETH in return for promoting a project, so long as it is done in a way of transparency and integrity.

I personally would disclose if I was paid to promote something and I would absolutely not do anything to take advantage of the community."

1,12,actually,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

3,12,actually,"14/ I then begin to look for clues on who the team actually is. 

I check the chain &amp; find clear ties to two different million dollar NFT rug pulls (first noticed by @NFTethics ) Ancient Cats Club &amp; Crazy Camels.

4,12,actually,"12/ To be fair to Beanie, he actually contributed in many ways to the NFT space. His tweets were intelligent and engaging about interesting projects, and nothing compared to what we currently see with scam rings using the “Follow, Retweet &amp; WL/Giveaway”, incentivized by greed."
