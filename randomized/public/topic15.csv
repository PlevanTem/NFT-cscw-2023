0,15,claim,@JoeMamaLuvzNFTs @thaka_gopal_ Best way to avoid being scammed by someone claiming to make ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù art is to just screenshot the piece in question &amp; do a reverse img search on google. Sucks that we can‚Äôt just trust the artist but the nft world is still the wild west and its up to the community to police it.

0,15,social,"@BobApposite @Jxrdan_NFT @KayeSteinsapir The whole concept of "" cancel"" culture was invented by the R wing to gaslight the social response to their racism, bigotry, and misogyny. I'm not saying it doesn't have (due) consequences. It's funny how it ""matters"" when its white people in power."
1,15,social,@FreeGuys_eth wow i honestly wasnt expecting this level of transparency and I appreciate it. Consider me more of a holder than ever. It's still such a cool concept for an NFT project and partnering with the innocence project could have real-world social benefits
