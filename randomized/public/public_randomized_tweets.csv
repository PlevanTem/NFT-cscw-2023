22,project,"If you’re an influencer and you want to get into the NFT space, you don’t get in by starting your own project. You gotta buy in, hold, sweep some floors, and give back… a lot. This is money that gains you an organic trust, and pays you back in the long run."

24,sell,"@SCBuergel @bneiluj I think one way is to make it look a legit sale to third party w/o the fees. If you can sell an nft wo fees, even in limited high trust enviros or something, people will use it to actually sell NFTs. Which makes your sale to yourself plausibly deniable. And therefore private."
24,sell,"GM!

It's amazing seeing friends and people you admire making sales so often
