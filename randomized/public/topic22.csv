0,22,trust,"@MickJayPlays @OccamRustySpoon @Beartruck1 @jasonschreier If that's the case, explain the enormous amount of art theft in the NFT community. The on-ramp for NFTs is a security hole that you can't plug, and it means that you can never fully trust the blockchain. It doesn't matter how robust your concensus is if blocks can lie."
1,22,trust,"@ChubertTS @veerman @shane_donohue_ @hakuwho @Libruary_NFT @nbatopshot @dallasmavs @warriors Let's agree to disagree: 

I trust in TS to strike a balance between the OG's w/ bottlenecks &amp; the new users who @nbatopshot has prioritized to collect team moments via marketing packs this way

You'll get your boost/perks! 

But collecting crap moments to get the nice‚úÖain't it"
0,22,thing,"There is a huge problem of recency bias in the nft space. 

Unless the project is BAYC, if it hasn't done anything in the past few weeks, people are tempted to forget it and just hop on to whatever is the current hot trend.

1,22,thing,"@_AskNemo @garyvee Screw that guy.  The VaynerSports mint was disaster that pulled out over 25M in equity from the eth NFT market this week.   His team didn't do the simplest things like us the 721A/Azuki contract for minting, etc.   Keep him away from Cardano."

1,22,project,"If you‚Äôre an influencer and you want to get into the NFT space, you don‚Äôt get in by starting your own project. You gotta buy in, hold, sweep some floors, and give back‚Ä¶ a lot. This is money that gains you an organic trust, and pays you back in the long run."
0,22,said,Hope the crypto/blockchain/nft space doesn‚Äôt replicate the same bias then all other industries. This tech suppose to make real change yet I see the same old behaviour creeping in. My boy said it @marcustroy Humans gonna human.
1,22,said,its so crazy months ago one of yall favorites said my art as nfts was just some cool cd covers... and now im a Art Director for very big Music NFT project that drops on Monday... mane dont ever let anyone shoot you down.. Stand Tall and Mount Up.. Trust your art.

Just like his platform that never launched. He also didnt have a roadmap of established artists already confirmed to take part of his drops the way alphadoggg does.He just said ‚Äútrust me‚Äù
1,22,didnt,"@NFTethics @TheSandboxGame FML

I have two Occulus sitting in a closet (Too distracted to return them yet) because FB is REQUIRED to use the platform...didnt know that before I bought the product.

I hate that Sandbox would sell to those jackals."
