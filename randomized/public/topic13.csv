0,13,value,"@gomez_sharks 100% transparency. typically, i use events like this to sell before the giveaway because price of coin/nft almost always drops way below value of what is being offered after lol 

for these and this project? i've minted 6 so far and am planning on doing 4 more to lock in the drop"
1,13,value,"This week, we are launching NFTs on Instagram! Though this test is starting with a small group of creators, we're excited to soon bring this to athletes who will showcase, display, and add  value to the many diverse NFT projects they are leading and participating in 📈📈📈 https://t.co/ruCVTDGpct"
0,13,info,"For transparency, I’d like to inform all delegators that WISH Pool is not scheduled to mint a block this epoch. After IOG delegation left, it may be a few months before our next block. In meantime, we are working on an NFT project that should be out next month. Stay positive! https://t.co/eMiXQ8Yjtr"

0,13,story,"@NFTethics I think history will also judge the so called “Real Influencers” who refuse to call the Scammers. They tweet about it but never mention any names. The worst thing, some are tagged in Scammers posts and others even FOLLOW confirmed Scammers."

0,13,ethical,you can tell NFTs aren't a scam by how how ethically NFT fans act online. they're definitely a bastion of just morality
1,13,ethical,"@NFTethics I didn’t find it unethical, I found it out of place

If you’re trying to build a brand that people trust and can rely on you to navigate web3 safety, it didn’t accomplish that.

Read what you wrote to all of us about what NFTethics is supposed to be, this didn’t compliment that"
0,13,moral,"@ReptilianReneg You have no ability to take the moral high ground unless you give those funds back to people. Maybe create your own project with a reverse mint, strict WL requirements. Everyone gets free minted NFT &amp; also gets 5 SOL or someting. Make the name have something to do with Robinhood"
1,13,moral,"""Abstinence based moral scolding"" sure is a fun way to backfoot anyone who might want to say that nft's and cryptocurrencies do real material and social harms, in fact massively exacerbating the extant material and social harms of the previous modes."

My dear NFT artist friends. Do not trust people who offer you a job and ask you to download a file. They still go on such cheap tricks to access your wallet information! DO NOT DOWNLOAD FILES!The scammer's instagram address is @jose_nft_crypto
