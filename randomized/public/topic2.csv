1,2,investor,"@addr1Algorithm @Peter08043180 @B0xcar @Psycheout86 Lol at least they didn't leave their investors, players, stake holders despite of what happened.

1,2,sure,"I'm not a creator, so I'm not sure how much I can do...

But since I am not a creator, I feel that I can discern the essentials.
