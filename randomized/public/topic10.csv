0,10,wrong,"@Cardinal_nft @bushdoctor77 @KhanzadaZarrar @UNHumanRights So you can't be swift to conclude that one side is wrong, it's all about the perspective you view it from. If you are Russian or in the shoes of Putin, trust me, you won't make such comments. Once again, the killings aren't justifiedble but they are inevitable"
1,10,wrong,"@CryptoTalath @dropacid8 @tropoFarmer They do but its also about trust. They have a small team for a reason. When you sign to list your nft on opensea, all that does is allow opensea to transfer your nft. If they hite the wrong people then imagine what would happen with all those BAYC listings."
0,10,fud,@NFTethics @yugalabs So what's the fud? Drop some FUD bruh so that we can buy BAYC/MAYC/$APE on the cheap.
1,10,fud,"I just can't stand people flexing money fudding people. Soft rugs are even worse than scammers. 

Choose wisely who you will trust, and keep safe in the NFT space. Money makes people show their real faces.

""WGMI"" is an illusion they want you to believe in üòâ"

0,10,care,"@UGEplex @RussellZee @blackrue The moment I saw this was some kind of NFT project my surprise went to 0%

NFT folks have no moral compass. They only care about getting a paycheck."
1,10,care,"Finally, I ask you to be more careful to buy and trust a collectible so that you do not get involved in these negative energies like me.
And know that in #nft space you have the right to have your own strategy and buy and sell what you paid for at your desired price."

1,10,try,"@GoldenBoyGrey1 @MRGOATNASTY @PangaeaGame I'm a little bias in having my focus on Cardano. I'm trying to bring in a few different artists as well. I'm hoping to find some musicians who will take some time to perform some new things. Then have NFT's they can sell. A channel to distribute some tasks and have ""shows"""
0,10,shit,"@beeverOne Trust me, I'm so not getting my shit together in this nft thing, feel damn lost"
1,10,shit,@NFT_wannabee You‚Äôll love it here TRUST ME we found this shit so early
0,10,understand,"@TEWZ1 I get it but things are a bit different as I understand here.

Most NFT creators are anonymous as compared to physical creators, so trust is a big thing here. That's why interaction is needed.

Unlike physical art, any random person can get recognition in NFT relatively easily."
1,10,understand,"@pxRobos I'm kinda new to the NFT space (started 1 month ago), for now I like listening to devs and their spaces and AMAs to better understand who I can trust in this world and their commitment to their projects. So I can def provide recaps of those to the community if needed lol"

1,10,trust,@josephmdurso Just everyone be careful. I had over 10k stolen on @FootballIndex. On the verge of losing everything. Non of it is our fault. Joey as been helping fight the battle for redress. Be very very careful. Id never trust crypto or anything nft ever again personally.
