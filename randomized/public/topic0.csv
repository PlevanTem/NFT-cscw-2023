0,0,building,"@yoloboydelis @The8point1 I disagree, we know what NFTs are &amp; we are in the space. It's not up to us to get ""our ass up"" as we are here, but are getting less opportunities &amp; bias clearly also has an effect. This is not on women. We're building a whole new virtual world, that can be better than IRL (1/5)"

1,0,project,I’ve seen several a promising NFT project collapse because of bad actors (not looking at anyone in particular *cough* solbears ). Ultimately these projects are functions of the community behind them. Integrity + transparency are core components of longevity. Let today be a lesson
