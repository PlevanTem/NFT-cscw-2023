Ever been a part of an NFT project where you are just a number and your opinions are not heard? Not with the SPC crew, a fully doxxed, fully transparent team that continually get the community involved on any decision. This team genuinely cares."

0,4,problem,"Another important aspect about the @saibagang Lore Roadmap is that it rewards everyone who participates/contributes qualitatively to grow the lore gang and Saibaverse, even if their submissions aren’t selected.

1,4,problem,"@0xBiased @GRW1971 @invariantlabs_ @monkeybetdao @NFTethics yes, I read it. And I see the allegations and where they lead to. Very disappointing stuff, and actually some of it was pretty inaccurate too.  I don't blame Invariant for a 'scam'. I do acknowledge there was a real execution problem, across many fronts.  I cant abandon monkeys."
