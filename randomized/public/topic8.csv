(hes a trust fund kid btw who wears helmut lang hoodies, frankly i was surprised)

1,8,investing,"Some people ask me, “Why do you have an actual picture of yourself instead of an NFT?”. I tell them that complete transparency is a huge part in starting an NFT because people are trusting you by investing their time and finances into you!

Sure at first you could ask why any #nft has value. But with every successful thing, there must something to trust structuring behind it all"

0,8,long,"An unpopular opinion perhaps but here it goes: the NFT terminology is one example why we need more #WomenInNFTs. Many women I know told me they feel like they don’t belong when they don’t even understand what’s being said. Let’s make this space more, not less inclusive 🙏✊ https://t.co/Pn2vR7BdBo"
1,8,long,@StarcatchersNFT This is impossible when you're on the other side of the world with slow internet. I've tried the all three times and no luck. Is there anyway you guys could keep it open longer or do something more inclusive for us individuals on the other side of the world with slow internet?
