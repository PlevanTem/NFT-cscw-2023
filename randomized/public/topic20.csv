1,20,trust,"@kitsune_777_ @Philocious1 @beeple This kinda defeats the purpose of NFT as trust (or third parties) will need to get involved. Was the main reason I didn’t buy one soon after the original drop. However, it seems the physical piece is less important through trades."
0,20,watch,"@zachxbt @NFTethics He is being set up, by exposing things it leaves him open to be framed for things he didn’t do. If you had a million dollar scam and some random person telling others to watch out, then throwing some money to try to discredit him would be a no brainer"

0,20,website,@NFTethics @zachxbt @fRiENDSiES_Ai Can't wait to see @zachxbt do a 1/16x wrap-up about the rug pull. Their own website gave me ptsd as it reminded me a lot about some recent rugs lol. They all must be hiring the same team h3h3
1,20,website,"@runGoodlife I’m all for it being a pocket in the NFT space reserved for the hobby. But their website is a terrible platform to begin with. I don’t trust it. Nor do I see value long term in that platform. Also, they have no roadmap. I have no clue what the future of panini blockchain is."

0,20,step,"With #NFTs approaching the mainstream, it’s getting harder for new NFT collections to stand out from the crowd. Here are the steps we’ve seen successful #NFT projects nail:
-Tell a compelling story
-Set up smart contracts
-Build community
-Create fairness 
-Lasting value&amp;innovate"
