0,18,doxxed,I was one of the giveaway winner of @TheFarmersGame and they send me the nft today and today they rugged. What an irony! It is hard to be a crypto/nft investor. I couldn't even %100 trust to the doxxed owner projects.

0,18,opportunity,"@Hogefather Well said. I‚Äôm thinking less about inequalities of opportunity (per your NFT example) than about how such inequalities replicate &amp; extend themselves. Unconscious bias finds its way into code. Defi, optimistic as I am about it, will generate its particular as yet unknown problems."

1,18,project,"@BAYC2745 I've noticed more and more that people like you, the real, transparent project creators, are the ones that not only create a community, but have a vision for people to feel like they have a home away from home. It's so amazing to have that feeling, before the mint."
0,18,trust,once a nft community does something snaky they have to work 5x harder to gain the peoples trust back‚Ä¶ go ask squiggles

As an NFT collector, I invest in new projects every day

One of the hardest things for me to get past is the lack of transparency. There is no NFT S-1 or 10-K

Even if a project lays out a well drawn roadmap and has a responsive and attentive team, my investment is opaque"
0,18,big,The reason why im keep improve and learn in this NFT World. Because this big name on Pentas already trust in my Project. Thank u so much for always support HYPECAT Project. https://t.co/NVx5qLT1qp
1,18,big,"I‚Äôm honestly surprised @zachxbt or @NFTethics never made a thread on one of the biggest slow rugger/scammer in the space, @TFGmykL. From @ApeKidsClub to @NFTMTG and @bapesclan , everything this guy touches ends up being a rug and he just moves on to making another project smfh"
0,18,guy,"@NFTethics And usually despite a high number of Discord followers these projects have next to zero engagement and presence on Twitter...

Looks a lot like some other recent rugs I have been following! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Be careful fam, #DYOR, and follow @NFTethics, these guys are doing important work!"

Now Mr. Hatoyama ain't no mess around type of guy and the people he has worked with and is working with are people that need to be transparent as Mr. Hatoyama name and rep is on the line as well.
