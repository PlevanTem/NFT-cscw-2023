0,11,yes,@jpmm_21 @SpeculatorArt @cagyjan1 @crypto_raiders @GalaxyFight_NFT @WhelpsNFT My eyes opened when I saw the transparency of the @PegaxyOfficial team
1,11,yes,"for real though - 
everyone take a break from entertaining these scammers 

yes, there was some poor decisions by @MagicEden_NFT BUT this only means we push for BETTER security from projects AND marketplaces/launchpads 

transparency is the goal"
0,11,buying,@Lacruzs1 @Micks2B @LFC Liverpool could issue tickets as NFT‚Äôs which would allow people to resell them without making a profit. It will solve the problem of ticket touts and also remove the trust needed when buying from another source. You‚Äôd know it was official and transferrable truslessly.
1,11,buying,Make sure you say *NFA before you help a normie get rekt on an NFT avatar project.  They literally have done zero research and are just buying bc they trust you and if they lose money its your fault regardless if its actually your fault.

0,11,trust,"... someone to have a working relationship steeped in trust, ESPECIALLY in the NFT sphere where people work off trust constantly. Trust that when the dust settles you'll be paid out. I've been BTS on a few projects and seen how things tick and its extremely common practice..."

What's your plan for this lovely Sunday?‚ù£Ô∏è

Transparency is important to us, so we'll be hard at work developing our roadmap, so you all can see our plans for the project ü•∞

but I have #Xpunks to give but i also have other Inclusive NFT projects ..
I'm just a a maniac who loves Nfts..
lets give em away...matter fact it may be a surprise from a new discovery ..woop"
0,11,better,"@BenS_MTG Think of how much better mtga would be if it had a co-operative ownership model or a sort of union. If someone put together a bottom up, player owned CCG, I would definitely invest in it to pay the designers and get some sort of equity. Blah blah blockchain NFT cards etc too."
1,11,better,"@TheMindOfSlyme @thetitanborn Yeah like it's okay to be skeptical but we should not be jumping to conclusions or demanding transparency like this , I know you're a great guy and you're only worried about creator getting false hopes but we gotta stick together to make NFT community stronger and better"
0,11,best,"@novocrypto I totally agree here. There‚Äôs three layers. 

1/ Anonymous - don‚Äôt know person or record. 

2/ Pseudonymous - know and trust the avatar and their track record. 

3/ Known - can recognise and trust the person and their track record. 

2/ and 3/ make for best NFT projects."
1,11,best,"Millionaire Raccoons (@MillRaccoons) is one of the best and most transparent #nft projects that I've seen.

The roadmap is clear and the perks are awesome! Only 500 of them with free NFT from future projects!

This is going to the moon!

0,11,lot,"@mamashellson @NotYourBroNFT @GirliesNFT @Crypto__Chicks @WomenTribe_nfts When presented with new info, we all have to pivot. Being married to @melissa_nft has helped me learn that, &amp; it‚Äôs a life long process!! The last several years have taught us all a lot about racial justice &amp; gender equity in particular. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to learn!"
1,11,lot,@dt_chain @CryptoDadsNFT are building a brand that will be around for decades. Fully doxxed and transparent communication with community. Accepting input from community for items in our nft world. Following through with every step of roadmap. And a lot of exciting things happening soon! https://t.co/SFNJpsU1ZD
