I gained a NFT couple years back (worked to educated myself and won it as result) now it is for sale and I will be stacking sats if it sells. No moral issues there"

And I am not one who opposes facts just bcos I have a bias. But it seems that is what you want me to do. However I wont stoop down to your level just for banter"
