0,5,ownership,"@FremAMR @RavenRickGrime1 @MorganCrow_NFT @leon_texas @Ravencoin @tronblack @TomYoungSoup @Just_NFTs @JoaquinChabers @HypemanRVN I can make one last point. NFTs can still be proof of ownership of any asset, but there is a bit of trust in transfer of ownership of the asset if it is physical. Digital asset ownership can be handled through a Peer 2 Peer  exchange such as @_RVNGuardian"
1,5,ownership,Incredible conversation happening today. Excited to hear more trends and how ownership is changing the game for diverse creators. #ThinkLA #NFT #Metaverse
0,5,digital,"@connectd86 A licence you buy to say you own a digital image (that people often have open access to).

The licence is stored on a ledger that the managing company may have open for people to see.
The image itself, may not be owned by the NFT seller

The idea is to create equity from nothing"

1,5,asset,"The #NFT market is currently undergoing high downside volatility in tandem with the broader crypto and equity markets. In times like these, the need for an uncorrelated digital asset class is apparent. https://t.co/l0d5F2yJoG"
0,5,year,"If you're looking for a brand that you can trust for the long-term, go for a company that has nearly 20 years of success BEFORE joining the #NFT space. I hold only 3 @AdamBombSquad so this isn't about a pump of my holdings, more reading tea leaves. Coinbase NFT is coming soon..."

0,5,token,"@iamLewcid @Timb0ghini @altura_nft I just hold it on trust wallet. If y they aren't native to the treasurer wallet app, you can add a token. Id check out a YouTube video showing how to work trust wallet"
1,5,token,"Why 210 tokens? We intentionally limited the size. We wanted it to be large enough to be valuable/diverse, but small enough to have a tight knit community. Most NFT collections are &gt;5,000. We chose a price point that involved a commitment from people who recognized the value."

0,5,equity,"New NFT called Real Estate, tangible, you can build equity with it over your life span, able to sleep in it, very crazy"
1,5,equity,"As we can see, fundraising announcements generally don't have a sustained increase on NFT sales volume or floor price.

VC equity investment is very different from buying NFTs, and NFT collectors often have short attention spans and low capital- and community-switching costs."
