0,19,game,@panda_airdrop24 @MechMaster_IO Can you explain the gameplay and the Mecha characters in the game to a newcomer with little knowledge of DeFi and Game NFT? Does it have diverse functions and benefits?
1,19,game,"There will be a Lana Frog avatar in the game for you to select. You don't necessarily need to own a frog to use this! That's where the inclusivity comes in - any one can play!

I think we will be seeing the release in the very near future, and hope to see a pond space soon! https://t.co/zjfuRegswV"
