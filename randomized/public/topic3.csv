1,3,remember,"Another @Opensea scam email is making the rounds. 

I want to make ALL novice NFT and cryptocurrency buyers to remember this one Cardinal rule:

🔴 YOU DO NOT HAVE TO VERIFY PRIVATE WALLETS (METAMASK, TRUST ETC) OR OPENSEA ACCOUNTS!

Stay Vigilante!

0,3,journey,@jeffexcell Alpha right here! You bring up great points. What resonated with me was “worrying less” and honing thy craft. Last year the worry got to me. I started to doubt myself. Then I saw this tweet by @Kenshiro_NFT &amp; it clicked. It helped me trust my journey &amp; get motivated again

0,3,bought,@CGSNO @darylquan8 @Hydraze420 @NFTethics Technically not true. If you buy a stolen bicycle or car... and authorities find it via serial number or Vin... it's considered an offense to hold stolen property so it's seized... with no compensation to the person who bought it whether they knew or not.
1,3,bought,"Out here rdtripping, &amp; got a while to go! Listening to @_anishagnihotri and @hasufl about NFT fairness in the minting process the @UCCPodcast  Go listen, Anish is brilliant. I bought into an NFT called The Great Reset by @farokh using party bid. Cool to hear the story behind it. https://t.co/UkF6vbr4Hp"
0,3,nft,"@mrdavediamond @psychedelic_nft Not fishy at all. @BAYC2745 has spent the last 6 weeks developing an incredible following through transparency and thoughtful development of his project team. The growth has been purely organic. I encourage you to visit the website and check it out. ✌🏼❤️

0,3,life,"In real life, the paper-based CoA is prone to forgery, however as NFT CoAs, always trust only the CoAs that come directly from the artist's blockchain address!

Irrevocable proof of provenance!

A physical Warhol is worthless without Warhol Foundation's stamp!

Bring it on chain! https://t.co/LGi3xXmFEj"
1,3,life,"My biggest recommendation for people whether it's for NFT trading or life; stick to your convictions. The worst mistakes I've made have been going back on my research and decisions. Once you commit to a path, stick it through. Don't FOMO into the next best thing, trust yourself."
